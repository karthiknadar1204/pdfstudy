AURICLE OR PINNA \nThe entire pinna except its lobule and the outer part of \nexternal acoustic canal are made up of a framework of a \nsingle piece \nof yellow elastic cartilage covered with skin. \nThe \nlatter is closely adherent to the perichondrium on \nits lateral surface while it is slightly loose on the me-\ndial (cranial) surface. The various elevations \nand depres-\nsions seen \non the lateral surface of pinna are shown in \nFigure l. lB. \nThere \nis no cartilage between the tragus and crus \nof the helix, and this area is called incisura terminalis \n(Figure 1.lC). An incision made in this area will not cut \nthrough the cartilage and is used for endaural approach \nin surgery of the external auditory canal or the mastoid. \nPinna is also the source of several graft materials for the \nsurgeon. Cartilage from the tragus, perichondrium from \nthe tragus or concha and fat from the lobule are fre-\nquently used for reconstructive surgery of the middle ear. \nThe \nconchal cartilage has also been used to correct the \ndepressed nasal bridge while the composite grafts of the \nskin and cartilage from the pinna are sometimes used for \nrepair \nof defects of nasal ala. \nB. EXTERNAL ACOUSTIC (AUDITORY) CANAL \nIt extends from the bottom of the concha to the tympan-\nic membrane and measures about 24 mm along its poste-\nrior wall. It \nis not a straight tube; its outer part is directed \nupwards, backwards \nand medially while its inner part is \ndirected downwards, forwards and medially. Therefore, to \nsee the tympanic membrane, the pinna has to be pulled \nupwards, backwards \nand laterally so as to bring the two \nparts \nin alignment. \nThe \ncanal is divided into two parts: (i) cartilaginous \nand (ii) bony. \n1. Cartilaginous Part \nIt forms outer one-third (8 mm) of the canal. Cartilage is a \ncontinuation of the cartilage which forms the framework \nof the pinna. It  has two deficiencies-the \"fissures of San-\ntorini\" in this part of the cartilage and through them the \nparotid or superficial mastoid infections can appear in the \ncanal or vice versa. The skin covering the cartilaginous ca-\nnal is thick and contains ceruminous and pilosebaceous \nglands \nwhich secrete wax. Hair is only confined to the \nouter canal and therefore furuncles (staphylococcal infec-\ntion of hair follicles) are seen only in the outer one-third \nof the canal. \n2. Bony Part \nIt  forms inner two-thirds (16 mm). Skin lining the bony \ncanal is thin and continuous over the tympanic mem-\nbrane. It is devoid of hair and ceruminous glands. About \n6 \nmm lateral to tympanic membrane, the bony mea-\ntus presents a \nnarrowing called isthmus. Foreign bodies, \nlodged medial \nto the isthmus, get impacted, and are dif-\nficult \nto remove. Anteroinferior part of the deep meatus, \nbeyond the isthmus, presents a  recess called anterior re-\ncess, which acts as a  cesspool for discharge and debris in \ncases of external and middle ear infections (Figure 1.2). \nAnteroinferior part of the bony canal may present a  de-\nficiency \n(foramen of Huschke) in children up to the age of \nfour or sometimes even in adults, permitting infections to \nand from the parotid. \nC.

Greater  auricular  nerve  (C\n2,3\n)  supplies  most  of  the  \nmedial surface of pinna and only posterior part of the \nlateral surface (Figure 1.6).\n2.  Lesser  occipital  (C\n2\n)  supplies  upper  part  of  medial  \n surface.\n3.  Auriculotemporal   (V\n3\n)  supplies  tragus,  crus  of  helix  \nand the adjacent part of the helix.\n4. Auricular branch of vagus (CN X), also called Arnold’s \nnerve,  supplies  the  concha  and  corresponding  emi-\nnence on the medial surface.\n5. Facial nerve, which is distributed with fibres of auricu-\nlar branch of vagus, supplies the concha and retroau-\nricular groove.\nExternal Auditory Canal\n1. Anterior wall and roof: auriculotemporal (V\n3\n).\n2.  Posterior  wall  and  floor:  auricular  branch  of  vagus  \n(CN X).\n3.  Posterior  wall  of  the  auditory  canal  also  receives  sen-\nsory fibres of CN VII through auricular branch of vagus \n(see Hitzelberger’s sign on p. 125).\nIn  herpes  zoster  oticus,  lesions  are  seen  in  the  distri-\nbution of facial nerve, i.e. concha, posterior part of tym-\npanic membrane and postauricular region.\nTympanic Membrane\n1. Anterior half of lateral surface: auriculotemporal (V\n3\n).\n2. Posterior half of lateral surface: auricular branch of va-\ngus (CN X).\n3.

It may be pneumatised in 30% of individuals, with \ncell tracts running either from the mastoid or hypotym-\npanum  (Figure  1.15).  They  run  inferior,  superior  or  an-\nterior to the bony capsule of the labyrinth and cochlea. \nThus various surgical approaches have been used to drain \nthe inflammatory or cystic lesions of the petrous apex.\n1.

        "Development of Mastoid\nMastoid develops from the squamous and petrous bones. \nThe petrosquamosal suture may persist as a bony plate—\nthe Korner’s septum, separating superficial squamosal cells \nfrom the deep petrosal cells. Korner’s septum is surgically \nimportant  as  it  may  cause  difficulty  in  locating  the  an-\ntrum and the deeper cells; and thus may lead to incom-\nplete removal of disease at mastoidectomy (Figure 1.14). \nMastoid  antrum  cannot  be  reached  unless  the  Korner’s  \nseptum has been removed.\nPetrous apex and its cell system\nThe  petrous  apex  lies  anterior  and  medial  to  the  laby-\nrinth. It may be pneumatised in 30% of individuals, with \ncell tracts running either from the mastoid or hypotym-\npanum  (Figure  1.15).

It divides the bony cochlea incom-\npletely  and  gives  attachment  to  the  basilar  membrane.  \nThe  bony  bulge  in  the  medial  wall  of  middle  ear,  the  \npromontory, is due to the basal coil of the cochlea. The \nbony cochlea contains three compartments:\n(a) Scala vestibuli,\n(b) Scala tympani,\n(c) Scala media or the membranous cochlea (Figure 1.18).\nThe  scala  vestibuli  and  scala  tympani  are  filled  with  \nperilymph and communicate with each other at the apex \nof  cochlea  through  an  opening  called  helicotrema.  Scala  \nvestibuli is closed by the footplate of stapes which sepa-\nrates it from the air-filled middle ear. The scala tympani is \nclosed by secondary tympanic membrane; it is also con-\nnected with the subarachnoid space through the aqueduct \nof cochlea (Figure 1.19).\nMEMBRANOUS LABYRINTH (FIGURE 1.17B)\nIt  consists  of  the  cochlear  duct,  the  utricle  and  saccule,  \nthe three semicircular ducts, and the endolymphatic duct \nand sac.\n1.  cochlear Duct (Figure 1.18). Also called membra-\nnous cochlea or the scala media. It is a blind coiled tube. \nIt  appears  triangular  on  cross-section  and  its  three  walls  \nare formed by:\n(a)  the  basilar  membrane,  which  supports  the  organ  of  \nCorti;\n(b) the Reissner’s membrane, which separates it from the \nscala vestibule; and\n(C)  the  stria  vascularis,  which  contains  vascular  epithe-\nlium and is concerned with secretion of endolymph.\nCochlear  duct  is  connected  to  the  saccule  by  ductus \nreuniens  (Figure  1.17B).  The  length  of  basilar  membrane  \nincreases as we proceed from the basal coil to the apical \ncoil. It is for this reason that higher frequencies of sound \nare heard at the basal coil while lower ones are heard at \nthe apical coil.\n2.  utricle and Saccule. The utricle lies in the posterior \npart of bony vestibule. It receives the five openings of the \nthree  semicircular  ducts.  It  is  also  connected  to  the  sac-\ncule  through  utriculosaccular  duct.

It  resembles  extracellular  fluid  and  is  \nrich  in  Na  ions.  It  fills  the  space  between  the  bony  and  \nthe  membranous  labyrinth.  It  communicates  with  CSF  \nthrough  the  aqueduct  of  cochlea  which  opens  into  the  \nscala tympani near the round window. In fact this duct is \nnot a direct communication but contains connective tis-\nsue resembling arachnoid through which perilymph per-\ncolates.  There  are  two  views  regarding  the  formation  of  \nperilymph: (i) It is a filtrate of blood serum and is formed \nby capillaries of the spiral ligament and (ii) it is a direct \ncontinuation of CSF and reaches the labyrinth via aque-\nduct of cochlea.\nFigure  1.18.

If the sound waves were to strike \nboth  the  windows  simultaneously,  they  would  cancel  \neach  other’s  effect  with  no  movement  of  the  perilymph  \nand  no  hearing.  This  acoustic  separation  of  windows  is  \nachieved  by  the  presence  of  intact  tympanic  membrane  \nand a cushion of air in the middle ear around the round \nwindow.

Natural resonance of external ear canal is \n3000 Hz and that of middle ear 800 Hz. Frequencies most \nefficiently  transmitted  by  ossicular  chain  are  between  \n500  and  2000  Hz  while  that  by  tympanic  membrane  is  \n800–1600 Hz. Thus greatest sensitivity of the sound trans-\nmission  is  between  500  and  3000  Hz  and  these  are  the  \nfrequencies most important to man in day-to-day conver-\nsation (Table 2.2).\n2. Transduction of Mechanical Energy to \nElectrical Impulses\nMovements  of  the  stapes  footplate,  transmitted  to  the  \ncochlear  fluids,  move  the  basilar  membrane  and  set  up  \nshearing  force  between  the  tectorial  membrane  and  the  \nhair cells. The distortion of hair cells gives rise to cochlear \nmicrophonics, which trigger the nerve impulse.\nA  sound  wave,  depending  on  its  frequency,  reaches  \nmaximum amplitude on a particular place on the basilar \nmembrane  and  stimulates  that  segment  (travelling  wave  \ntheory  of  von  Bekesy).  Higher  frequencies  are  represented  \nin the basal turn of the cochlea and the progressively low-\ner ones towards the apex (Figure 2.4).\n3. Neural Pathways\nHair  cells  get  innervation  from  the  bipolar  cells  of  \nspiral ganglion. Central axons of these cells collect to \nform the cochlear nerve which goes to the ventral and \ndorsal  cochlear  nuclei.  From  there,  both  crossed  and  \nuncrossed fibres travel to the superior olivary nucleus, \nlateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate \nbody and finally reach the auditory cortex of the tem-\nporal  lobe  (Brodmann’s  area  41  situated  at  the  superior  \naspect  of  the  temporal  lobe  along  the  floor  of  the  lateral  \ncerebral fissure).\nELECTRICAL POTENTIALS OF COCHLEA \nAND CN VIII\nFour  types  of  potentials  have  been  recorded;  three  from  \nthe cochlea and one from CN VIII fibres. They are:\n1. Endocochlear potential\n2. Cochlear microphonic\n3. Summating potential\nfrom cochlea\n4. Compound action potentialfrom nerve fibres\n1. endocochlear potential. It is a direct current (DC) \npotential  recorded  from  scala  media.  It  is  +80  mV  and  \nis  generated  from  the  stria  vascularis  by  Na\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase \npump  and  provides  source  of  energy  for  cochlear  trans-\nduction  (Figure  2.5).  It  is  present  at  rest  and  does  not  \nrequire sound stimulus. This potential provides a sort of \n“battery”  to  drive  the  current  through  hair  cells  when  \nthey move in response to a sound stimulus.\nFigure 2.3. Transformer action of the middle ear. Hydraulic effect of \ntympanic membrane and lever action of ossicles combine to compen-\nsate  the  sound  energy  lost  during  its  transmission  from  air  to  liquid  \nmedium.\nFigure 2.4.

Neural Pathways\nHair  cells  get  innervation  from  the  bipolar  cells  of  \nspiral ganglion.

The sen-\nsory hair cells of the macula lie in different planes and are \nstimulated  by  displacement  of  otolithic  membrane  dur-\ning the head tilts.\nThe function of saccule is similar to that of utricle as \nthe structure of maculae in the two organs is similar but \nexperimentally,  the  saccule  is  also  seen  to  respond  to  \nsound vibrations.\nThe  vestibular  system  thus  registers  changes  in  the  \nhead  position,  linear  or  angular  acceleration  and  decel-\neration, and gravitational effects. This information is sent \nto  the  central  nervous  system  where  information  from  \nother systems—visual, auditory, somatosensory (muscles, \njoints, tendons, skin)—is also received. All this informa-\ntion  is  integrated  and  used  in  the  regulation  of  equilib-\nrium and body posture.\nCerebellum, which is also connected to vestibular end \norgans,  further  coordinates  muscle  movements  in  their  \nrate,  range,  force  and  duration  and  thus  helps  in  the  \nmaintenance of balance.\nMAINTENANCE OF BODY EQUILIBRIUM\nA useful clinical approach to understand the physiology \nof equilibrium is to imagine that the balance system (ves-\ntibular,  visual  and  somatosensory)  is  a  two-sided  push  \nand pull system. In static neutral position, each side con-\ntributes equal sensory information, i.e. push and pull sys-\ntem of one side is equal to that of the other side.

The sen-\nsory hair cells of the macula lie in different planes and are \nstimulated  by  displacement  of  otolithic  membrane  dur-\ning the head tilts.\nThe function of saccule is similar to that of utricle as \nthe structure of maculae in the two organs is similar but \nexperimentally,  the  saccule  is  also  seen  to  respond  to  \nsound vibrations.\nThe  vestibular  system  thus  registers  changes  in  the  \nhead  position,  linear  or  angular  acceleration  and  decel-\neration, and gravitational effects.

It is caused by any disease \nprocess  interfering  with  the  conduction  of  sound  from  \nthe external ear to the stapediovestibular joint. Thus the \ncause may lie in the external ear (obstructions), tympanic \nmembrane (perforation), middle ear (fluid), ossicles (fixa-\ntion or disruption) or the eustachian tube (obstruction).\n2. sensorineural  (sn) hearing  loss.  It  results  from  \nlesions of the cochlea (sensory type) or VIIIth nerve and \nits central connections (neural type). The term retrococh-\nlear is used when hearing loss is due to lesions of VIIIth \nnerve,  and  central  deafness,  when  it  is  due  to  lesions  of  \ncentral auditory connections.\n3. mixed hearing loss. In this type, elements of both \nconductive and sensorineural deafness are present in the \nsame ear. There is air-bone gap indicating conductive el-\nement,  and  impairment  of  bone  conduction  indicating  \nsensorineural  loss.  Mixed  hearing  loss  is  seen  in  some  \ncases of otosclerosis and chronic suppurative otitis media.\nWhile  assessing  the  auditory  function  it  is  important  \nto find out:\n(a) Type   of   hearing   loss   (conductive,   sensorineural   or   \nmixed).\n(b) Degree of hearing loss (mild, moderate, moderately se-\nvere, severe, profound or total).\n(c) Site  of  lesion.  If  conductive,  the  lesion  may  be  at  ex-\nternal  ear,  tympanic  membrane,  middle  ear,  ossicles  \nor eustachian tube.

The disadvantage \nof speech tests is lack of standardization in intensity and \npitch of voice used for testing and the ambient noise of \nthe testing place.\n4.

Pure Tone Audiometry\nAn  audiometer  is  an  electronic  device  which  produces  \npure tones, the intensity of which can be increased or de-\ncreased in 5 dB steps (Figure 4.2). Usually air conduction \nthresholds are measured for tones of 125, 250, 500, 1000, \n2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz and bone conduction thresholds \nfor  250,  500,  1000,  2000  and  4000  Hz.  The  amount  of  \nintensity that has to be raised above the normal level is a \nmeasure of the degree of hearing impairment at that fre-\nquency. It is charted in the form of a graph called audio-\ngram. The threshold of bone conduction is a measure of \ncochlear function.

Speech Audiometry\nIn  this  test,  the  patient’s  ability  to  hear  and  understand  \nspeech is measured. Two parameters are studied: (i) speech \nreception threshold and (ii) discrimination score.\n(a)  speech reception threshold ( srt). It is the mini-\nmum  intensity  at  which  50%  of  the  words  are  repeated  \ncorrectly by the patient. A set of spondee words (two sylla-\nble words with equal stress on each syllable, e.g. baseball, \nsunlight, daydream, etc.) is delivered to each ear through \nthe headphone of an audiometer. The word lists are deliv-\nered in the form of recorded tapes or monitored voice and \ntheir intensity varied in 5 dB steps till half of them are cor-\nrectly heard. Normally, SRT is within 10 dB of the average \nof  pure  tone  threshold  of  three  speech  frequencies  (500,  \n1000 and 2000 Hz). An SRT better than pure tone average \nby more than 10 dB suggests a functional hearing loss.\n(b)  speech  discrimination  score.  Also  called  speech \nrecognition or word recognition score. It is a measure of pa-\ntient’s  ability  to  understand  speech.

Tympanome-\ntry has also been used to find function of eustachian tube \nin  cases  of  intact  or  perforated  tympanic  membrane.  A  \nnegative or a positive pressure (−200 or +200 mm H\n2\nO) is \ncreated in the middle ear and the person is asked to swal-\nlow five times in 20 s. The ability to equilibrate the pres-\nsure indicates normal tubal function. The test can also be \nused  to  find  the  patency  of  the  grommet  placed  in  the  \ntympanic membrane in cases of serous otitis media.\n(b) acoustic reFlex. It is based on the fact that a loud \nsound,  70–100  dB  above  the  threshold  of  hearing  of  a  \nparticular ear, causes bilateral contraction of the stapedial \nmuscles  which  can  be  detected  by  tympanometry.  Tone  \ncan be delivered to one ear and the reflex picked from the \nsame or the contralateral ear. The reflex arc involved is:\nIpsilateral:  CN  VIII  →  ventral  cochlear  nucleus  →  CN  \nVII nucleus ipsilateral stapedius muscle.\nContralateral:  CN  VIII  →  ventral  cochlear  nucleus  → \ncontralateral medial superior olivary nucleus → contralat-\neral  CN  VII  nucleus  →  contralateral  stapedius  muscle  \n(Figure 4.7).\nThis test is useful in several ways:\n(i) To test the hearing in infants and young children. It \nis an objective method.\n(ii) To find malingerers. A person who feigns total deaf-\nness  and  does  not  give  any  response  on  pure  tone  \naudiometry but shows a positive stapedial reflex is a \nmalingerer.\n(iii)  To  detect  cochlear  pathology.  Presence  of  stapedial  \nreflex  at  lower  intensities,  e.g.  40–60  dB  than  the  \nusual  70  dB  indicates  recruitment  and  thus  a  coch-\nlear type of hearing loss.\n(iv)   To  detect  VIIIth  nerve  lesion.  If  a  sustained  tone  of  \n500 or 1000 Hz, delivered 10 dB above acoustic reflex \nthreshold, for a period of 10 s, brings the reflex ampli-\ntude to 50%, it shows abnormal adaptation and is in-\ndicative of VIIIth nerve lesion (stapedial reflex decay).\n(v)  Lesions  of  facial  nerve.  Absence  of  stapedial  reflex  \nwhen hearing is normal indicates lesion of the facial \nnerve, proximal to the nerve to stapedius.

Normally it is up to \n1.0  mL  in  children  and  2  mL  in  adults.  Any  increase  in  \nvolume, >2  mL  in  children  and  >2.5  mL  in  adults,  in-\ndicates  perforation  of  the  tympanic  membrane  (because  \nmiddle ear volume is added up to the volume of external \near canal). This has also been used to find patency of the \nventilation tube.\nC. SPECIAL TESTS OF HEARING\n1. Recruitment\nIt is a phenomenon of abnormal growth of loudness. The \near  which  does  not  hear  low  intensity  sound  begins  to  \nhear greater intensity sounds as loud or even louder than \nnormal hearing ear. Thus, a loud sound which is tolerable \nin  normal  ear  may  grow  to  abnormal  levels  of  loudness  \nin  the  recruiting  ear  and  thus  becomes  intolerable.  The  \npatients  with  recruitment  are  poor  candidates  for  hear-\ning  aids.  Recruitment  is  typically  seen  in  lesions  of  the  \ncochlea (e.g. Ménière’s disease and presbycusis) and thus \nhelps to differentiate a cochlear from a retrocochlear sen-\nsorineural hearing loss.\nAlternate binaural loudness balance test is used to detect \nrecruitment in unilateral cases. A tone, say of 1000 Hz, is \nplayed alternately to the normal and the affected ear and \nthe intensity in the affected ear is adjusted to match the \nloudness in normal ear. The test is started at 20 dB above \nthe threshold of deaf ear and then repeated at every 20 dB \nrise  until  the  loudness  is  matched  or  the  limits  of  audi-\nometer  reached.  In  conductive  and  neural  deafness,  the  \ninitial difference is maintained throughout while in coch-\nlear lesions, partial, complete or over-recruitment may be \nseen (Figure 4.8).\n2. Short Increment Sensitivity Index \n(SISI Test)\nPatients with cochlear lesions distinguish smaller chang-\nes  in  intensity  of  pure  tone  better  than  normal  persons  \nand  those  with  conductive  or  retrocochlear  pathology.  \nSISI  test  is  thus  used  to  differentiate  a  cochlear  from  a  \nretrocochlear lesion.\nIn this test, a continuous tone is presented 20 dB above \nthe threshold and sustained for about 2 min. Every 5 s, the \ntone is increased by 1 dB and 20 such blips are presented. \nPatient indicates the blips heard. In conductive deafness, \nSISI  score  is  seldom  more  than  15%;  it  is  70–100%  in  \ncochlear deafness and 0–20% in nerve deafness.\n3. Threshold Tone Decay Test\nIt is a measure of nerve fatigue and is used to detect ret-\nrocochlear  lesions.  Normally,  a  person  can  hear  a  tone  \ncontinuously for 60 s. In nerve fatigue, he stops hearing \nearlier. The threshold tone decay test is simple and is per-\nformed in the following manner:\nA tone of 4000 Hz is presented at 5 dB above the pa-\ntient’s threshold of hearing, continuously for a period of \n60 s. If patient stops hearing earlier, intensity is increased \nby another 5 dB. The procedure is continued till patient \ncan hear the tone continuously for 60 s, or no level exists \nabove  the  threshold  where  tone  is  audible  for  full  60  s.  \nThe result is expressed as number of dB of decay. A decay \nmore than 25 dB is diagnostic of a retrocochlear lesion.\n4. Evoked Response Audiometry\nIt is an objective test which measures electrical activity in \nthe auditory pathways in response to auditory stimuli. It \nrequires special equipment with an averaging computer. \nThere are several components of evoked electric response \nbut only two have gained clinical acceptance. They are:\n(a) Electrocochleography  (EcoG).  It  measures  electrical  \npotentials arising in the cochlea and CN VIII in response \nto  auditory  stimuli  within  first  5  ms.  The  response  is  \nin the form of three phenomena: cochlear microphon-\nics,  summating  potentials  and  the  action  potential  of  \nVIIIth  nerve.  The  recording  electrode  is  usually  a  thin  \nneedle  passed  through  the  tympanic  membrane  onto  \nthe  promontory.  In  adults,  it  can  be  done  under  local  \nanaesthesia  but  in  children  or  anxious  persons  seda-\ntion  or  general  anaesthesia  is  required.  Sedation  does  \nnot  interfere  in  these  responses.  EcoG  is  useful  (i)  to  \nfind threshold of hearing in young infants and children \nFigure 4.8.

Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR)\nThough ABR, conducted with tone bursts of various fre-\nquencies,  can  produce  frequency-specific  thresholds  of  \nhearing in infants to fit hearing aid at a young age, it has \nlimitations.  It  cannot  test  hearing  losses  above  80  dB.  \nIt  cannot  detect  hearing  sensitivity  in  severe  to  pro-\nfoundly  deaf  infants.  ASSR  is  useful  in  such  situations.  \nIt  is,  like  ABR,  an  electrophysiological  test  which  uses  \nsteady state pure tone signals instead of transient signals \nof  tone  bursts  or  clicks  used  in  ABR.  The  steady  state  \nsignals are also modulated rapidly in amplitude and fre-\nquency  and  thus  gives  a  frequency-specific  audiogram.  \nHearing  losses  exceeding  80  dB  can  be  detected.  It  can  \nhelp  in  selection  of  children  for  cochlear  implantation  \nat an early age.\n6. Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs)\nThey  are  low-intensity  sounds  produced  by  outer  hair  \ncells  of  a  normal  cochlea  and  can  be  elicited  by  a  very  \nsensitive microphone placed in the external ear canal and \nanalyzed  by  a  computer.  Sound  produced  by  outer  hair  \ncells travels in a reverse direction: outer hair cells → basi-\nlar membrane → perilymph → oval window → ossicles → \ntympanic membrane → ear canal. OAEs are present when \nouter hair cells are healthy and are absent when they are \ndamaged  and  thus  help  to  test  the  function  of  cochlea.  \nThey do not disappear in VIIIth nerve pathology as coch-\nlear hair cells are normal.\ntypes oF  oaes.  Broadly  OAEs  are  of  two  types:  spon-\ntaneous  and  evoked.  The  latter  are  elicited  by  a  sound  \nstimulus.\n(a) Spontaneous  OAEs.  They  are  present  in  healthy  nor-\nmal  hearing  persons  where  hearing  loss  does  not  \nexceed 30 dB. They may be absent in 50% of normal \npersons.\n(b) Evoked OAEs. They are further divided into two types \ndepending on the sound stimulus used to elicit them.\n(i) Transient evoked OAEs (TEOAEs). Evoked by clicks. \nA series of click stimuli are presented at 80–85 dB \nSPL (sound pressure level) and response recorded.\n(ii) Distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs). Two tones are \nsimultaneously  presented  to  the  cochlea  to  pro-\nduce distortion products. They have been used to \ntest hearing in the range of 1000–8000 Hz.\nuses\n(a)  OAEs  are  used  as  a  screening  test  of  hearing  in  neo-\nnates and to test hearing in uncooperative or mentally \nchallenged  individuals  after  sedation.  Sedation  does  \nnot interfere with OAEs.\n(b) They help to distinguish cochlear from retrocochlear \nhearing loss. OAEs are absent in cochlear lesions, e.g. \nototoxic  sensorineural  hearing  loss.  They  detect  oto-\ntoxic effects earlier than pure tone audiometry.\n(c) OAEs are also useful to diagnose retrocochlear pathol-\nogy, especially auditory neuropathy. Auditory neurop-\nathy is a neurologic disorder of CN VIII. Audiometric \ntests,  e.g.  SNHL  for  pure  tones,  impaired  speech  dis-\ncrimination score, absent or abnormal auditory brain-\nstem response, show a retrocochlear type of lesion but \nOAEs are normal.\nFigure 4.10.

Hear-\ning loss of hypothyroidism can be reversed with replacement \ntherapy. Serous labyrinthitis can be reversed by attention to \nmiddle ear infection. Early management of Ménière’s disease \ncan  prevent  further  episodes  of  vertigo  and  hearing  loss.  \nSNHL  due  to  perilymph  fistula  can  be  corrected  surgically  \nby sealing the fistula in the oval or round window with fat.\nOtotoxic drugs should be used with care and discontin-\nued if causing hearing loss. In many such cases, it may be \npossible  to  regain  hearing,  total  or  partial,  if  the  drug  is  \nstopped. Noise-induced hearing loss can be prevented from \nfurther  deterioration  if  the  person  is  removed  from  the  \nnoisy surroundings.\nRehabilitation  of  hearing  impaired  with  hearing  aids  \nand other devices is discussed in Chapter 20.\nSPECIFIC FORMS OF HEARING LOSS\nA. INFLAMMATIONS OF LABYRINTH\nIt may be viral, bacterial or syphilitic.\n1. Viral  labyrinthitis.  Viruses  usually  reach  the  in-\nner ear by blood stream affecting stria vascularis and then \nthe endolymph and organ of Corti. Measles, mumps and \ncytomegaloviruses  are  well-documented  to  cause  laby-\nrinthitis. Several other viruses, e.g. rubella, herpes zoster, \nherpes simplex, influenza and Epstein–Barr are clinically \nknown  to  cause  deafness  but  direct  proof  of  their  inva-\nsion of labyrinth is lacking.\n2.  bacterial.    Bacterial    infections    reach    labyrinth    \nthrough  the  middle  ear  (tympanogenic)  or  through  CSF  \n(meningogenic). Labyrinthitis as a complication of mid-\ndle  ear  infection  is  discussed  on  page  45.  Sensorineural  \nhearing  loss  following  meningitis  is  a  well-known  clini-\ncal entity. Bacteria can invade the labyrinth along nerves, \nvessels,  cochlear  aqueduct  or  the  endolymphatic  sac.  \nMembranous labyrinth is totally destroyed.\n3.  syphilitic. Sensorineural hearing loss is caused both \nby  congenital  and  acquired  syphilis.  Congenital  syphi-\nlis is of two types: the early form, manifesting at the age \nof 2 or the late form, manifesting at the age of 8–20 years. \nSyphilitic involvement of the inner ear can cause:\n(a) Sudden sensorineural hearing loss, which may be uni-\nlateral or bilateral. The latter is usually symmetrical in \nhigh frequencies or is a flat type.\n(b)  Ménière’s  syndrome  with  episodic  vertigo,  fluctuat-\ning hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness—a picture \nsimulating Ménière’s disease.\n(c) Hennebert’s sign. A positive fistula sign in the absence \nof a fistula. This is due to fibrous adhesions between \nthe stapes footplate and the membranous labyrinth.\n(d)  Tullio  phenomenon  in  which  loud  sounds  produce  \nvertigo.\nDiagnosis  of  otosyphilis  can  be  made  by  other  clinical  \nevidence of late acquired or congenital syphilis (interstitial \nkeratitis, Hutchinson’s teeth, saddle nose, nasal septal per-\nforation and frontal bossing) and the laboratory tests. Fluo-\nrescent treponema-absorption test (FTA-ABS) and venereal \ndisease research laboratory (VDRL) or rapid plasma reagin \n(RPR) tests from CSF are useful to establish the diagnosis.\nTreatment  of  otosyphilis  includes  i.v.  penicillin  and  \nsteroids.\nB. FAMILIAL PROGRESSIVE SENSORINEURAL \nHEARING LOSS\nIt is a genetic disorder in which there is progressive degen-\neration of the cochlea starting in late childhood or early \nadult life. Hearing loss is bilateral with flat or basin-shaped \naudiogram but an excellent speech discrimination.\nC. OTOTOXICITY\nVarious  drugs  and  chemicals  can  damage  the  inner  ear  \nand cause sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and some-\ntimes vertigo (Table 5.4).\n1.  aminoglycoside  antibiotics.  Streptomycin,  gen-\ntamicin  and  tobramycin  are  primarily  vestibulotoxic.  \nThey selectively destroy type I hair cells of the crista am-\npullaris but, administered in large doses, can also damage \nthe cochlea.\nNeomycin,  kanamycin,  amikacin,  sisomycin  and  di-\nhydrostreptomycin are cochleotoxic. They cause selective \ndestruction  of  outer  hair  cells,  starting  at  the  basal  coil  \nand progressing onto the apex of cochlea.\nPatients particularly at risk are those:\n(a) having impaired renal function,\n(b) elderly people above the age of 65,\n(c) concomitantly receiving other ototoxic drugs,\n(d) who have already received aminoglycoside antibiotics,\n(e)  who  are  receiving  high  doses  of  ototoxic  drugs  with  \nhigh serum level of drug, and\n(f)  who  have  genetic  susceptibility  to  aminoglycosides.  \nHere  the  antibiotic  binds  to  the  ribosome  and  inter-\nferes with protein synthesis, thus causing death of the \ncochlear cells.\nSymptoms of ototoxicity, hearing loss, tinnitus and/or \ngiddiness may manifest during treatment or after comple-\ntion of the treatment (delayed toxicity).\nmebooksfree.com",

Hear-\ning loss of hypothyroidism can be reversed with replacement \ntherapy. Serous labyrinthitis can be reversed by attention to \nmiddle ear infection. Early management of Ménière’s disease \ncan  prevent  further  episodes  of  vertigo  and  hearing  loss.  \nSNHL  due  to  perilymph  fistula  can  be  corrected  surgically  \nby sealing the fistula in the oval or round window with fat.\nOtotoxic drugs should be used with care and discontin-\nued if causing hearing loss. In many such cases, it may be \npossible  to  regain  hearing,  total  or  partial,  if  the  drug  is  \nstopped. Noise-induced hearing loss can be prevented from \nfurther  deterioration  if  the  person  is  removed  from  the  \nnoisy surroundings.\nRehabilitation  of  hearing  impaired  with  hearing  aids  \nand other devices is discussed in Chapter 20.\nSPECIFIC FORMS OF HEARING LOSS",

INFLAMMATIONS OF LABYRINTH\nIt may be viral, bacterial or syphilitic.\n1. Viral  labyrinthitis.  Viruses  usually  reach  the  in-\nner ear by blood stream affecting stria vascularis and then \nthe endolymph and organ of Corti. Measles, mumps and \ncytomegaloviruses  are  well-documented  to  cause  laby-\nrinthitis. Several other viruses, e.g. rubella, herpes zoster, \nherpes simplex, influenza and Epstein–Barr are clinically \nknown  to  cause  deafness  but  direct  proof  of  their  inva-\nsion of labyrinth is lacking.\n2.  bacterial.    Bacterial    infections    reach    labyrinth    \nthrough  the  middle  ear  (tympanogenic)  or  through  CSF  \n(meningogenic). Labyrinthitis as a complication of mid-\ndle  ear  infection  is  discussed  on  page  45.  Sensorineural  \nhearing  loss  following  meningitis  is  a  well-known  clini-",

Sensorineural  \nhearing  loss  following  meningitis  is  a  well-known  clini-\ncal entity. Bacteria can invade the labyrinth along nerves, \nvessels,  cochlear  aqueduct  or  the  endolymphatic  sac.  \nMembranous labyrinth is totally destroyed.\n3.  syphilitic. Sensorineural hearing loss is caused both \nby  congenital  and  acquired  syphilis.  Congenital  syphi-\nlis is of two types: the early form, manifesting at the age \nof 2 or the late form, manifesting at the age of 8–20 years. \nSyphilitic involvement of the inner ear can cause:\n(a) Sudden sensorineural hearing loss, which may be uni-\nlateral or bilateral. The latter is usually symmetrical in \nhigh frequencies or is a flat type.\n(b)  Ménière’s  syndrome  with  episodic  vertigo,  fluctuat-\ning hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness—a picture \nsimulating Ménière’s disease.",

Hearing loss caused by excessive noise can \nbe divided into two groups:\n1.  acoustic   trauma.   Permanent   damage   to   hear-\ning  can  be  caused  by  a  single  brief  exposure  to  very  in-\ntense sound without this being preceded by a temporary \nthreshold shift. Also called impulse noise, such noise can \narise  from  an  explosion,  gun  fire  or  a  powerful  cracker  \nand  may  reach  or  cross  140  dB.  Noise  level  of  a  gun  or  \nrifle  may  reach  140–170  dB  SPL  (sound  pressure  level).  \nSuch  brief  and  loud  noises  mechanically  damage  organ  \nof Corti, tear Reissner’s membrane, rupture hair cells and \nallowing mixing of perilymph and endolymph. A severe \nblast,  in  addition,  may  concomitantly  damage  the  tym-\npanic membrane and disrupt ossicles further adding con-\nductive loss. Impulse noise may be as brief as 0.2 ms. No \nimpulse noise more than 140 dB (A) is permitted.\n2.  noise-induced hearing loss (nihl). Hearing loss, \nin this case, follows chronic exposure to less intense sounds \nthan  seen  in  acoustic  trauma  and  is  mainly  a  hazard  of  \nnoisy occupations.\n(a) Temporary threshold shift (TTS). The hearing is impaired \nimmediately after exposure to noise but recovers after \nan  interval  of  a  few  minutes  to  a  few  hours  even  up  \nto 2 weeks.

The  hearing  impair-\nment is permanent and does not recover at all.\nThe damage caused by noise trauma depends on sev-\neral factors:\n  (i)    Frequency  of  noise.  A  frequency  of  2000–3000  Hz  \ncauses more damage than lower or higher frequen-\ncies.\n (ii)   Intensity and duration of noise. As the intensity in-\ncreases,  permissible  time  for  exposure  is  reduced.  \nTable  5.5  gives  the  permissible  limits  of  time  for  \nvarious intensity levels for the safety of ear.\n (iii)   Continuous vs interrupted noise. Continuous noise is \nmore harmful.\n (iv)   Susceptibility  of  the  individual.  Degree  of  TTS  and  \nPTS varies in different individuals.\n (v) Pre-existing ear disease.\nA noise of 90 dB (A) SPL, 8 h a day for 5 days per week \nis the maximum safe limit as recommended by Ministry \nof  Labour,  Govt.  of  India,  Model  Rules  under  Factories  \nAct (Table 5.5). No exposure in excess of 115 dB (A) is to \nbe permitted. No impulse noise of intensity greater than \n140 dB (A) is permitted.\nThe  Noise  Pollution  (Regulation  and  Control)  Rules  \n2000, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Govt. of India \nhas defined permissible limits of noise for various zones \nor  areas  (Table  5.6).  According  to  which  silence  zone  is  \n100 m around the premises of hospitals, nursing homes, \neducational  institutions  and  courts.  Also  manufacture,  \nsale and use of fire crackers generating sound level above \n125 dB (AI) or 145 dB (C) pk from 4 m distance from the \npoint  of  bursting  are  not  permitted  (Environment  Pro-\ntection Rules 2006) [dB (AI) = A-weighted impulse sound \npressure  level  in  decibels;  dB  (C)  pk  =  C-weighted  peak  \nsound pressure in decibels].\nThe  audiogram  in  NIHL  shows  a  typical  notch,  at  \n4    kHz,  both  for  air  and  bone  conduction  (Figure  5.7).  It  \nis  usually  symmetrical  on  both  sides.  At  this  stage,  pa-\ntient complains of high-pitched tinnitus and difficulty in \nhearing in noisy surroundings but no difficulty in day-to-\nday hearing. As the duration of noise exposure increases, \nthe notch deepens and also widens to involve lower and \nhigher  frequencies.  Hearing  impairment  becomes  clini-\ncally  apparent  to  the  patient  when  the  frequencies  of  \n500, 1000 and 2000 Hz (the speech frequencies) are also \naffected.\nNIHL causes damage to hair cells, starting in the basal \nturn  of  cochlea.  Outer  hair  cells  are  affected  before  the  \ninner hair cells.\nNoise-induced  hearing  loss  is  preventable.  Persons  \nwho  have  to  work  at  places  where  noise  is  above  85  dB  \n(A) should have pre-employment and then annual audio-\ngrams for early detection. Ear protectors (ear plugs or ear \nmuffs)  should  be  used  where  noise  levels  exceed  85  dB  \n(A). They provide protection up to 35 dB (see Table 5.7). If \nhearing impairment has already occurred, rehabilitation \nis similar to that employed for other sensorineural hear-\ning losses.\n3.  nonauditory  eFFects oF  noise.

Intratympanic  steroids  therapy.  It  raises  the  lo-\ncal  concentration  of  steroids  in  cochlear  fluids,  thus  \navoiding side effects of systemic therapy.\nTreatment\nMany  treatment  protocols  have  been  suggested  for  idi-\nopathic  sensorineural  sudden  hearing  loss  but  none  has  \nshown  significant  benefit  over  the  benefit  of  spontane-\nous  recovery  which  occurs  in  50–60%  cases  within  first  \n2 weeks. None of the drugs, dextran 40, vasodilators, car-\nbogen inhalation (5% CO\n2\n with 95% O\n2\n), diatrizoate me-\nglumine, have shown significant benefit.\nGenerally prescribed medicines include:\n1.  Steroids.\n2. Inhalation of carbogen.\n3. Low-salt diet and a diuretic.\n4. Hyperbaric oxygen.\nPrognosis\nFortunately, about half the patients of idiopathic sensori-\nneural hearing loss recover spontaneously within 15 days. \nChances of recovery are poor after 1 month. Severe hear-\ning loss and that associated with vertigo have poor prog-\nnosis. Younger patients below 40 and those with moder-\nate losses have better prognosis (see Table 5.8).\nG. PRESBYCUSIS\nSensorineural  hearing  loss  associated  with  physiological  \naging  process  in  the  ear  is  called  presbycusis.  It  usually  \nmanifests  at  the  age  of  65  years  but  may  do  so  early  if  \nthere is hereditary predisposition, chronic noise exposure \nor generalized vascular disease.\nFour pathological types of presbycusis have been iden-\ntified.\n1.  sensory. This is characterized by degeneration of the \norgan of Corti, starting at the basal coil and progressing \ngradually to the apex. Higher frequencies are affected but \nspeech discrimination remains good.\n2.  neural. This is characterized by degeneration of the \ncells of spiral ganglion, starting at the basal coil and pro-\ngressing  to  the  apex.  Neurons  of  higher  auditory  path-\nways may also be affected.

American Academy of Ophthalmology and Oto-\nlaryngology recommends and takes into account the av-\nerage  of  four  frequencies  500,  1000,  2000  and  3000  Hz  \nwhen calculating the handicap.\nGovernment  of  India  reserved  certain  percentage  of  \nvacancies in Group C and D in favour of the physically \nhandicapped  and  has  extended  certain  other  benefits.  \nIt  has  also  recommended  the  classification  based  on",

CLINICAL TESTS OF VESTIBULAR \nFUNCTION\nA. SPONTANEOUS NYSTAGMUS\nNystagmus  is  an  important  sign  in  the  evaluation  of  \nvestibular  system.  It  is  defined  as  involuntary,  rhythmi-\ncal, oscillatory movement of eyes. It may be horizontal, \nvertical or rotatory. Vestibular nystagmus has a slow and \na  fast  component,  and  by  convention,  the  direction  of  \nnystagmus is indicated by the direction of the fast com-\nponent. Intensity of nystagmus is indicated by its degree \n(Table 6.1).\nTo elicit nystagmus, patient is seated in front of the ex-\naminer or lies supine on the bed. The examiner keeps his \nfinger about 30 cm from the patient’s eye in the central \nposition and moves it to the right or left, up or down, but \nnot moving at any time more than 30° from the central \nposition to avoid gaze nystagmus. Presence of spontane-\nous nystagmus always indicates an organic lesion.\nVestibular nystagmus is called peripheral, when it is due \nto  lesion  of  labyrinth  or  VIIIth  nerve  and  central,  when  \nlesion is in the central neural pathways (vestibular nuclei, \nbrainstem, cerebellum).\nIrritative  lesions  of  the  labyrinth  (serous  labyrinthi-\ntis) cause nystagmus to the side of lesion. Paretic lesions \n(purulent  labyrinthitis,  trauma  to  labyrinth,  section  of  \nVIIIth nerve) cause nystagmus to the healthy side. Nystag-\nmus of peripheral origin can be suppressed by optic fixa-\ntion by looking at a fixed point, and enhanced in darkness \nor by the use of Frenzel glasses (+20 dioptre glasses) both \nof which abolish optic fixation.\nNystagmus   of   central   origin   cannot   be   suppressed   \nby  optic  fixation.  Purely  torsional  nystagmus  indicates  le-\nsion  of  the  brainstem/vestibular  nuclei  and  is  seen  in  \nsyringomyelia. Vertical downbeat nystagmus indicates lesion \nat craniocervical region such as Arnold–Chiari malforma-\ntion  or  degenerative  lesion  of  the  cerebellum.  Vertical  up-\nbeat  nystagmus  is  seen  in  lesions  at  the  junction  of  pons  \nand medulla or pons and midbrain. Pendular nystagmus is \neither  congenital  or  acquired.  The  latter  is  seen  in  multi-\nple  sclerosis.  Pendular  nystagmus  may  also  be  disconju-\ngate,  i.e.  vertical  in  one  eye  and  horizontal  in  the  other.  \nTable 6.2 shows differences in the nystagmus of peripheral \nand central lesions.\nB. FISTULA TEST\nThe  basis  of  this  test  is  to  induce  nystagmus  by  pro-\nducing  pressure  changes  in  the  external  canal  which  \nare  then  transmitted  to  the  labyrinth.  Stimulation  of  \nlabyrinth  results  in  nystagmus  and  vertigo.  The  test  is  \nperformed by applying intermittent pressure on the tra-\ngus or by using Siegel’s speculum. Normally, the test is \nnegative  because  the  pressure  changes  in  the  external  \nauditory canal cannot be transmitted to the labyrinth. \nIt is positive when there is erosion of horizontal semi-\ncircular canal as in cholesteatoma or a surgically created \nwindow  in  the  horizontal  canal  (fenestration  opera-\ntion),  abnormal  opening  in  the  oval  window  (poststa-\npedectomy  fistula)  or  the  round  window  (rupture  of  \nround  window  membrane).  A  positive  fistula  also  im-\nplies that the labyrinth is still functioning; it is absent \nwhen labyrinth is dead. A false negative fistula test is also \nseen when cholesteatoma covers the site of fistula and \ndoes not allow pressure changes to be transmitted to the \nlabyrinth.\nA false positive fistula test (i.e. positive fistula test with-\nout the presence of a fistula) is seen in congenital syphilis \nand in about 25% cases of Ménière’s disease (Hennebert’s \nsign).  In  congenital  syphilis,  stapes  footplate  is  hyper-\nmobile while in Ménière’s disease it is due to the fibrous \nbands connecting utricular macula to the stapes footplate. \nIn both these conditions, movements of stapes result in \nstimulation of the utricular macula.\nC. ROMBERG TEST\nThe patient is asked to stand with feet together and arms \nby  the  side  with  eyes  first  open  and  then  closed.  With  \nthe  eyes  open,  patient  can  still  compensate  the  imbal-\nance  but  with  eyes  closed,  vestibular  system  is  at  more  \ndisadvantage.  In  peripheral  vestibular  lesions,  the  pa-\ntient  sways  to  the  side  of  lesion.  In  central  vestibular  \ndisorder,  patient  shows  instability.  If  patient  can  per-\nform  this  test  without  sway,  “sharpened  Romberg  test”  \nis performed. In this the patient stands with one heel in \nfront of toes and arms folded across the chest. Inability \nto perform the sharpened Romberg test indicates vestib-\nular impairment.\nD.

This test is done when there \nis  perforation  of  tympanic  membrane  because  irrigation  \nwith water in such a case with perforation is contraindi-\ncated.  The  test  employs  Dundas  Grant  tube,  which  is  a  \ncoiled copper tube wrapped in cloth. The air in the tube \nis cooled by pouring ethyl chloride and then blown into \nthe ear. It is only a rough qualitative test.\nB. ELECTRONYSTAGMOGRAPHY\nIt is a method of detecting and recording of nystagmus, \nwhich  is  spontaneous  or  induced  by  caloric,  positional,  \nrotational  or  optokinetic  stimulus.  The  test  depends  on  \nthe presence of corneoretinal potentials which are record-\ned by placing electrodes at suitable places round the eyes. \nThe test is also useful to detect nystagmus, which is not \nseen with the naked eye. It also permits to keep a perma-\nnent record of nystagmus.\nC. OPTOKINETIC TEST\nPatient  is  asked  to  follow  a  series  of  vertical  stripes  on  a  \ndrum  moving  first  from  right  to  left  and  then  from  left  \nto  right.  Normally  it  produces  nystagmus  with  slow  \ncomponent  in  the  direction  of  moving  stripes  and  fast  \ncomponent in the opposite direction. Optokinetic abnor-\nmalities  are  seen  in  brainstem  and  cerebral  hemisphere  \nlesions. Thus this test is useful to diagnose a central lesion.\nD. ROTATION TEST\nPatient is seated in Barany’s revolving chair with his head \ntilted 30° forward and then rotated 10 turns in 20 s. The \nchair  is  stopped  abruptly  and  nystagmus  observed.  Nor-\nmally there is nystagmus for 25–40 s. The test is useful as \nit can be performed in cases of congenital abnormalities \nwhere ear canal has failed to develop and it is not possible \nto perform the caloric test. Disadvantage of the test is that \nboth the labyrinths are simultaneously stimulated during \nthe  rotation  process  and  cannot  be  tested  individually.  \nThe  test  has  now  been  made  more  sophisticated  by  the  \nuse  of  torsion  swings,  electronystagmography  and  com-\nputer analysis of the results.\nE. GALVANIC TEST\nIt is the only vestibular test which helps in differentiating \nan end organ lesion from that of vestibular nerve. Patient \nstands  with  his  feet  together,  eyes  closed  and  arms  out-\nstretched  and  then  a  current  of  1  mA  is  passed  to  one  \near.  Normally,  person  sways  towards  the  side  of  anodal  \ncurrent. Body sway can be studied by a special platform.\nF. POSTUROGRAPHY\nIt  is  a  method  to  evaluate  vestibular  function  by  measur-\ning postural stability and is based on the fact that mainte-\nnance of posture depends on three sensory inputs—visual, \nvestibular  and  somatosensory.  It  uses  either  a  fixed  or  a  \nmoving platform. Visual cues can also be varied. The clini-\ncal application of posturography is still under investigation.\nG. VESTIBULAR EVOKED MYOGENIC \nPOTENTIALS (VEMP)\nThis is a test to study function of otolith organs—the sac-\ncule  and  utricle.  Normally  their  function  is  linear  accel-\neration. They can also be stimulated by loud sound of air \nor bone conduction. Even tapping the head can stimulate \nthem. Myogenic potentials can be picked up from either \nthe sternocleidomastoid (cervical) muscle or ocular mus-\ncle (inferior oblique or superior rectus) and have respec-\ntively been called cVEMP and oVEMP.\nSince  saccule  is  supplied  by  the  inferior  division  of  \nnerve and utricle by the superior division, study of VEMP \nin neuroma can help us to find its origin from the supe-\nrior or inferior division.\nReflex arc is:\nFrom   saccule—inferior   vestibular—vestibular   nuclei—\nipsilateral   vestibular   spinal   tract—spinal   accessory   \nnerve (CN XI)—sternocleidomastoid\nFrom    utricle—superior    vestibular    nerve—vestibular     \nnuclei—medial   longitudinal   fasciculus—oculomotor   \n(CNIII) nerve—inferior oblique muscle\nAir-conducted  sounds  primarily  activate  the  saccule,  \nwhile  bone-conducted  sounds  activate  both  the  saccule  \nand the utricle.\nVEMP study is being used clinically and the equipment \nis  also  available  but  needs  further  research.

        "The test is also useful to detect nystagmus, which is not \nseen with the naked eye. It also permits to keep a perma-\nnent record of nystagmus.\nC. OPTOKINETIC TEST\nPatient  is  asked  to  follow  a  series  of  vertical  stripes  on  a  \ndrum  moving  first  from  right  to  left  and  then  from  left  \nto  right.  Normally  it  produces  nystagmus  with  slow  \ncomponent  in  the  direction  of  moving  stripes  and  fast  \ncomponent in the opposite direction. Optokinetic abnor-\nmalities  are  seen  in  brainstem  and  cerebral  hemisphere  \nlesions. Thus this test is useful to diagnose a central lesion.\nD. ROTATION TEST\nPatient is seated in Barany’s revolving chair with his head \ntilted 30° forward and then rotated 10 turns in 20 s. The \nchair  is  stopped  abruptly  and  nystagmus  observed.

POSTUROGRAPHY\nIt  is  a  method  to  evaluate  vestibular  function  by  measur-\ning postural stability and is based on the fact that mainte-\nnance of posture depends on three sensory inputs—visual, \nvestibular  and  somatosensory.  It  uses  either  a  fixed  or  a  \nmoving platform. Visual cues can also be varied. The clini-\ncal application of posturography is still under investigation.\nG. VESTIBULAR EVOKED MYOGENIC \nPOTENTIALS (VEMP)\nThis is a test to study function of otolith organs—the sac-\ncule  and  utricle.  Normally  their  function  is  linear  accel-\neration.

In  this  condition,  perilymph  \nleaks into the middle ear through the oval or round win-\ndow. It can follow as a complication of stapedectomy, or \near surgery when stapes is accidentally dislocated. It can \nalso  result  from  sudden  pressure  changes  in  the  middle  \near  (e.g.  barotrauma,  diving,  forceful  Valsalva)  or  raised  \nintracranial  pressure  (weightlifting  or  vigorous  cough-\ning).

Reactive Group\n•\tEczematous otitis externa\n•\tSeborrhoeic otitis externa\n•\tNeurodermatitis\n(a)  Furuncle  (localiZed  acute  otitis  externa). A \nfuruncle is a staphylococcal infection of the hair follicle. \nAs the hair are confined only to the cartilaginous part of \nthe meatus, furuncle is seen only in this part of meatus. \nUsually single, the furuncles may be multiple.\nPatient  usually  presents  with  severe  pain  and  tender-\nness which are out of proportion to the size of the furun-\ncle. Movements of the pinna are painful. Jaw movements, \nas  in  chewing,  also  cause  pain  in  the  ear.  A  furuncle  of  \nposterior  meatal  wall  causes  oedema  over  the  mastoid  \nwith  obliteration  of  the  retroauricular  groove.  Periauric-\nular  lymph  nodes  (anterior,  posterior  and  inferior)  may  \nalso be enlarged and tender.\nTreatment  in  early  cases,  without  abscess  formation,  \nconsists of systemic antibiotics, analgesics and local heat. \nAn ear pack of 10% ichthammol glycerine provides splin-\ntage and reduces pain. Hygroscopic action of glycerine re-\nduces  oedema,  while  ichthammol  is  mildly  antiseptic.  If  \nabscess has formed, incision and drainage should be done.\nIn case of recurrent furunculosis, diabetes should be ex-\ncluded,  and  attention  paid  to  the  patient’s  nasal  vesti-\nbules which may harbour staphylococci and the infection \ntransferred by patient’s fingers. Staphylococcal infections \nof  the  skin  as  a  possible  source  should  also  be  excluded  \nand suitably treated.\n(b) diFFuse otitis externa. It is diffuse inflammation \nof  meatal  skin  which  may  spread  to  involve  the  pinna  \nand epidermal layer of tympanic membrane.\nAetiology. Disease is commonly seen in hot and humid \nclimate  and  in  swimmers.  Excessive  sweating  changes  \nthe pH of meatal skin from that of acid to alkaline which \nfavours growth of pathogens. Two factors commonly re-\nsponsible for this condition are:\n(i) trauma to the meatal skin and\n(ii) invasion by pathogenic organisms.\nTrauma  can  result  from  scratching  the  ear  canal  with  \nhair  pins  or  matchsticks,  unskilled  instrumentation  to  \nremove  foreign  bodies  or  vigorous  cleaning  of  ear  canal  \nafter a swim when meatal skin is already macerated. Break \nin continuity of meatal lining sets the ground for organ-\nisms to invade.\nCommon  organisms  responsible  for  otitis  externa  are  \nStaphylococcus  aureus,  Pseudomonas  pyocyaneus,  Bacillus  \nproteus  and  Escherichia  coli  but  more  often  the  infection  \nis mixed.\nSome cases of otitis externa are secondary to infection \nof  the  middle  ear,  or  allergic  sensitization  to  the  topical  \near drops used for chronic suppurative otitis media.\nClinical features. Diffuse otitis externa may be acute or \nchronic with varying degrees of severity.\nAcute  phase  is  characterized  by  hot  burning  sensa-\ntion in the ear, followed by pain which is aggravated by \nmovements of jaw. Ear starts oozing thin serous discharge \nwhich  later  becomes  thick  and  purulent.  Meatal  lining  \nbecomes inflamed and swollen. Collection of debris and \ndischarge accompanied with meatal swelling gives rise to \nconductive hearing loss. In severe cases, regional lymph \nnodes become enlarged and tender with cellulitis of the \nsurrounding tissues.\nChronic phase is characterized by irritation and strong \ndesire to itch. This is responsible for acute exacerbations \nand  reinfection.  Discharge  is  scanty  and  may  dry  up  to  \nform crusts. Meatal skin which is thick and swollen may \nalso show scaling and fissuring. Rarely, the skin becomes \nhypertrophic  leading  to  meatal  stenosis  (chronic  stenotic  \notitis externa).\nTreatment. Acute phase is treated as follows:\n(i) Ear toilet. It is the most important single factor in the \ntreatment  of  diffuse  otitis  externa.  All  exudate  and  \ndebris should be meticulously and gently removed. \nSpecial  attention  should  be  paid  to  anteroinferior  \nmeatal recess, which forms a blind pocket where dis-\ncharge is accumulated. Ear toilet can be done by dry \nmopping,  suction  clearance  or  irrigating  the  canal  \nwith warm, sterile normal saline.\n(ii) Medicated wicks. After thorough toilet, a gauze wick \nsoaked in antibiotic steroid preparation is inserted in \nthe ear canal and patient advised to keep it moist by \ninstilling the same drops twice or thrice a day. Wick \nis changed daily for 2–3 days when it can be substi-\ntuted by ear drops. Local steroid drops help to relieve \noedema, erythema and prevent itching. Aluminium \nacetate  (8%)  or  silver  nitrate  (3%)  are  mild  astrin-\ngents and can be used in the form of a wick to form \na protective coagulum to dry-up an oozing meatus.\n(iii) Antibiotics.  Broad-spectrum  systemic  antibiotics  are  \nused  when  there  is  cellulitis  and  acute  tender  lym-\nphadenitis.\n(iv) Analgesics. For relief of pain.\nChronic phase. Treatment aims at (i) reduction of meatal \nswelling so that ear toilet can be effectively done and (ii) \nalleviation  of  itching  so  that  scratching  is  stopped  and  \nfurther recurrences controlled.\nA gauze wick soaked in 10% ichthammol glycerine and \ninserted  into  the  canal  helps  to  reduce  swelling.  This  is  \nfollowed by ear toilet with particular attention to antero-\ninferior meatal recess. Itching can be controlled by topi-\ncal application of antibiotic steroid cream.\nmebooksfree.com",

Periauric-\nular  lymph  nodes  (anterior,  posterior  and  inferior)  may  \nalso be enlarged and tender.\nTreatment  in  early  cases,  without  abscess  formation,  \nconsists of systemic antibiotics, analgesics and local heat. \nAn ear pack of 10% ichthammol glycerine provides splin-\ntage and reduces pain.

        "favours growth of pathogens. Two factors commonly re-\nsponsible for this condition are:\n(i) trauma to the meatal skin and\n(ii) invasion by pathogenic organisms.\nTrauma  can  result  from  scratching  the  ear  canal  with  \nhair  pins  or  matchsticks,  unskilled  instrumentation  to  \nremove  foreign  bodies  or  vigorous  cleaning  of  ear  canal  \nafter a swim when meatal skin is already macerated. Break \nin continuity of meatal lining sets the ground for organ-\nisms to invade.\nCommon  organisms  responsible  for  otitis  externa  are  \nStaphylococcus  aureus,  Pseudomonas  pyocyaneus,  Bacillus  \nproteus  and  Escherichia  coli  but  more  often  the  infection  \nis mixed.\nSome cases of otitis externa are secondary to infection \nof  the  middle  ear,  or  allergic  sensitization  to  the  topical  \near drops used for chronic suppurative otitis media.\nClinical features.

Diffuse otitis externa may be acute or \nchronic with varying degrees of severity.\nAcute  phase  is  characterized  by  hot  burning  sensa-\ntion in the ear, followed by pain which is aggravated by \nmovements of jaw. Ear starts oozing thin serous discharge \nwhich  later  becomes  thick  and  purulent.  Meatal  lining  \nbecomes inflamed and swollen. Collection of debris and \ndischarge accompanied with meatal swelling gives rise to \nconductive hearing loss. In severe cases, regional lymph \nnodes become enlarged and tender with cellulitis of the \nsurrounding tissues.\nChronic phase is characterized by irritation and strong \ndesire to itch.

Rarely, the skin becomes \nhypertrophic  leading  to  meatal  stenosis  (chronic  stenotic  \notitis externa).\nTreatment. Acute phase is treated as follows:\n(i) Ear toilet. It is the most important single factor in the \ntreatment  of  diffuse  otitis  externa.  All  exudate  and  \ndebris should be meticulously and gently removed. \nSpecial  attention  should  be  paid  to  anteroinferior  \nmeatal recess, which forms a blind pocket where dis-\ncharge is accumulated. Ear toilet can be done by dry \nmopping,  suction  clearance  or  irrigating  the  canal  \nwith warm, sterile normal saline.\n(ii) Medicated wicks.

Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the \near canal that often occurs due to Aspergillus niger, A. fu-\nmigatus or Candida albicans. It is seen in hot and humid \nclimate  of  tropical  and  subtropical  countries.  Secondary  \nfungal growth is also seen in patients using topical anti-\nbiotics for treatment of otitis externa or middle ear sup-\npuration.\nThe clinical features of otomycosis include intense itch-\ning, discomfort or pain in the ear, watery discharge with \na  musty  odour  and  ear  blockage.  The  fungal  mass  may  \nappear white, brown or black and has been likened to a \nwet piece of filter paper.\nExamined with an otoscope, A. niger appears as black-\nheaded filamentous growth, A. fumigatus as pale blue or \ngreen  and  Candida  as  white  or  creamy  deposit.  Meatal  \nskin appears sodden, red and oedematous.\nTreatment consists of thorough ear toilet to remove all \ndischarge  and  epithelial  debris  which  are  conducive  to  \nthe  growth  of  fungus.  It  can  be  done  by  syringing,  suc-\ntion  or  mopping.  Specific  antifungal  agents  can  be  ap-\nplied.  Nystatin  (100,000  units/mL  of  propylene  glycol)  \nis effective against Candida.

It consists of:\n(i) Control of diabetes.\n(ii)  Toilet  of  ear  canal.  Remove  discharge,  debris  and  \ngranulations or any dead tissue or bone.\n(iii)   Antibiotic   treatment   against   causative   organism,   \nwhich in most ears is P. aeruginosa, but sometimes oth-\ner organisms which can be found by culture and sensi-\ntivity.

In  contrast  to  middle  ear  cholesteatoma,  squa-\nmous  epithelium  of  the  external  canal  invades  its  bone.  \nUsually there is some abnormality of bone of external ca-\nnal which is conducive for epithelium to invade it. It may \nbe post-traumatic or postsurgical. Clinical features include \npurulent  otorrhoea  and  pain;  tympanic  membrane  being  \nnormal.  Granulations  associated  with  sequestrated  bone  \nneed histological examination to differentiate it from carci-\nnoma, necrotizing otitis externa and a benign sequestrum.\nTreatment  consists  of  removal  of  necrotic  bone  and  \ncholesteatoma, and lining the defect with fascia.\nD. TUMOURS\nSee p. 118.\nE. MISCELLANEOUS CONDITIONS\n1. impacted  wax or  cerumen. Wax  is  composed  of  \nsecretion  of  sebaceous  glands,  ceruminous  glands,  hair,  \ndesquamated epithelial debris, keratin and dirt.\nSebaceous  and  ceruminous  (modified  sweat  glands)  \nglands  open  into  the  space  of  the  hair  follicle  (Fig-\nure 8.9). Sebaceous glands provide fluid rich in fatty acids \nwhile secretion of ceruminous gland is rich in lipids and \npigment granules. Secretion of both these glands mixes \nwith  the  desquamated  epithelial  cells  and  keratin  shed  \nfrom the tympanic membrane and deep bony meatus to \nform wax.\nWax  has  a  protective  function  as  it  lubricates  the  ear  \ncanal  and  entraps  any  foreign  material  that  happens  to  \nenter the canal. It has acidic pH and is bacteriostatic and \nfungistatic.\nNormally,  only  a  small  amount  of  wax  is  secreted,  \nwhich dries up and is later expelled from the meatus by \nmovements of the jaw. As some people sweat more than \nothers, the activity of ceruminous glands also varies; ex-\ncessive  wax  may  be  secreted  and  deposited  as  a  plug  in  \nthe meatus. Certain other factors like narrow and tortu-\nous ear canal, stiff hair or obstructive lesion of the canal, \ne.g. exostosis, may favour retention of wax. It may dry up \nand form a hard impacted mass.\nPatient  usually  presents  with  impairment  of  hearing  \nor sense of blocked ear. Tinnitus and giddiness may result \nfrom impaction of wax against the tympanic membrane. \nReflex cough due to stimulation of auricular branch of va-\ngus may sometimes occur. The onset of these symptoms \nmay  be  sudden  when  water  enters  the  ear  canal  during  \nbathing or swimming and the wax swells up. Long stand-\ning impacted wax may ulcerate the meatal skin and result \nin granuloma formation (wax granuloma).\nTreatment of wax consists in its removal by syringing \nor instrumental manipulation. Hard impacted mass may \nsometimes require prior softening with wax solvents.\nTechnique of syringing the ear. Patient is seated with ear \nto  be  syringed  towards  the  examiner.  A  towel  is  placed  \nround his neck. A kidney tray is placed over the shoulder \nand held snugly by the patient. Patient’s head is slightly \ntilted over the tray to collect the return fluid.\nPinna is pulled upwards and backwards and a stream of \nwater from the ear syringe is directed along the postero-\nsuperior  wall  of  the  meatus.  Pressure  of  water,  built  up  \ndeeper  to  the  wax,  expels  the  wax  out  (Figure  8.10 ). \nIf wax is tightly impacted, it is necessary to create a space \nbetween it and the meatal wall for the jet of water to pass, \notherwise syringing will be ineffective or may even push \nthe wax deeper.

Certain other factors like narrow and tortu-\nous ear canal, stiff hair or obstructive lesion of the canal, \ne.g. exostosis, may favour retention of wax. It may dry up \nand form a hard impacted mass.\nPatient  usually  presents  with  impairment  of  hearing  \nor sense of blocked ear.

Mucous  \nmembrane of the eustachian tube and anterior part of \nthe middle ear is lined by ciliated columnar cells. The \ncilia  beat  in  the  direction  of  nasopharynx.  This  helps  \nto clear the secretions and debris in the middle ear to-\nwards the nasopharynx. The clearance function is fur-\nther  augmented  by  active  opening  and  closing  of  the  \ntube.\nEUSTACHIAN TUBE FUNCTION TESTS\n1. ValsalVa  test.  The  principle  of  this  test,  as  also  of  \npolitzerization,  is  to  build  positive  pressure  in  the  naso-\npharynx so that air enters the eustachian tube.

Functional  obstruction  is  caused  by  collapse  of  \nthe tube due to increased cartilage compliance, which re-\nsists opening of the tube or failure of active tubal-opening \nmechanism due to poor function of tensor veli palatini. \nThe  common  clinical  conditions  which  can  cause  tubal  \nobstruction are listed in Table 9.3.\nSymptoms  of  tubal  occlusion  include  otalgia,  which  \nmay  be  mild  to  severe,  hearing  loss,  popping  sensation,  \ntinnitus and disturbances of equilibrium or even vertigo.\nSigns  of  tubal  occlusion  will  vary  and  depend  upon  \nthe acuteness of the condition and severity. They include \nretracted  tympanic  membrane,  congestion  along  the  \nhandle of malleus and the pars tensa, transudate behind \nthe  tympanic  membrane,  imparting  it  an  amber  colour  \nand sometimes a fluid level with conductive hearing loss. \nIn  severe  cases,  as  in  barotrauma,  tympanic  membrane  \nis markedly retracted with haemorrhages in subepithelial \nlayer, haemotympanum or sometimes a perforation.\n2. adenoids and  eustachian  tube  Function.

Usu-\nally,  they  occur  after  acute  upper  respiratory  infection,  \nthe  child  being  free  of  symptoms  between  the  episodes.  \nRecurrent middle infections may sometimes be superim-\nposed upon an existing middle ear effusion. Sometimes, \nthe  underlying  cause  is  recurrent  sinusitis,  velopharyn-\ngeal insufficiency, hypertrophy of adenoids, infected ton-\nsils, allergy and immune deficiency. Feeding the babies in \nsupine position without propping up the head may also \ncause  the  milk  to  enter  the  middle  ear  directly  that  can  \nlead to middle ear infection.\nManagement of such children involves:\n1. Finding the cause and eliminating it, if possible.\n2. Antimicrobial  prophylaxis.  Amoxicillin  (20  mg/kg  for  \n3–6 months) or sulfisoxazole have been used but they \nprevent  only  1–2  bouts  of  otitis  media  in  a  year  and  \nhave the disadvantage of creating antimicrobial resist-\nance  or  hypersensitivity  reaction  and  thus  not  pre-\nferred by many in favour of early insertion of tympa-\nnostomy tubes.\n3. Myringotomy and insertion of tympanostomy tube. If the \nchild has 4 bouts of acute otitis media in 6 months or \n6 bouts in 1 year, insertion of a tympanostomy tube is \nrecommended.\n4. Adenoidectomy with or without tonsillectomy.\n5. Management of inhalant or food allergy.\nAERO-OTITIS MEDIA (OTITIC \nBAROTRAUMA)\nIt is a nonsuppurative condition resulting from failure of \neustachian tube to maintain middle ear pressure at ambi-\nent  atmospheric  level.  The  usual  cause  is  rapid  descent  \nduring  air  flight,  underwater  diving  or  compression  in  \npressure chamber.\nMECHANISM\nEustachian tube allows easy and passive egress of air from \nmiddle ear to the pharynx if middle ear pressure is high. \nIn  the  reverse  situation,  where  nasopharyngeal  air  pres-\nsure is high, air cannot enter the middle ear unless tube is \nactively opened by the contraction of muscles as in swal-\nlowing,  yawning  or  Valsalva  manoeuvre.  When  atmos-\npheric pressure is higher than that of middle ear by criti-\ncal level of 90 mm Hg, eustachian tube gets “locked,” i.e. \nsoft tissues of pharyngeal end of the tube are forced into \nits  lumen.  In  the  presence  of  eustachian  tube  oedema,  \neven smaller pressure differentials cause “locking” of the \ntube. Sudden negative pressure in the middle ear causes \nretraction  of  tympanic  membrane,  hyperaemia  and  en-\ngorgement of vessels, transudation and haemorrhages.\nSometimes, though rarely, there is rupture of labyrin-\nthine membranes with vertigo and sensorineural hearing \nloss.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nSevere  earache,  hearing  loss  and  tinnitus  are  common  \ncomplaints. Vertigo is uncommon. Tympanic membrane \nappears retracted and congested. It may get ruptured.\nMiddle ear may show air bubbles or haemorrhagic ef-\nfusion. Hearing loss is usually conductive but sensorineu-\nral type of loss may also be seen.\nTREATMENT\nThe aim is to restore middle ear aeration. This is done by \ncatheterization  or  politzerization.  In  mild  cases,  decon-\ngestant nasal drops or oral nasal decongestant with anti-\nhistaminics are helpful. In the presence of fluid or failure \nof  the  above  methods,  myringotomy  may  be  performed  \nto “unlock” the tube and aspirate the fluid.\nPREVENTION\nAero-otitis can be prevented by the following measures:\n1.  Avoid  air  travel  in  the  presence  of  upper  respiratory  \ninfection or allergy.\n2. Swallow repeatedly during descent. Sucking sweets or \nchewing gum is useful.\n3.

It \nis called primary as there is no history of previous otitis \nmedia or a pre-existing perforation. Theories on its gen-\nesis are:\n(a) Invagination  of  pars  flaccida.  Persistent  negative  pres-\nsure in the attic causes a retraction pocket which ac-\ncumulates keratin debris. When infected, the keratin \nmass expands towards the middle ear. Thus, attic per-\nforation is in fact the proximal end of an expanding \ninvaginated sac.\n(b) Basal  cell  hyperplasia.  There  is  proliferation  of  the  ba-\nsal  layer  of  pars  flaccida  induced  by  subclinical  child-\nhood infections. Expanding cholesteatoma then breaks \nthrough pars flaccida forming an attic perforation.\n(c) Squamous  metaplasia.  Normal  pavement  epithelium  \nof   attic   undergoes   metaplasia,   keratinizing   squa-\nmous  epithelium  due  to  subclinical  infections.

In  these  \ncases,  there  is  already  a  pre-existing  perforation  in  pars  \ntensa. This is often associated with posterosuperior mar-\nginal perforation or sometimes large central perforation. \nTheories on its genesis include:\n(a) Migration  of  squamous  epithelium.  Keratinizing  squa-\nmous epithelium of external auditory canal or outer \nsurface of tympanic membrane migrates through the \nperforation into the middle ear. Perforations, involv-\ning  tympanic  annulus  as  in  acute  necrotizing  otitis  \nmedia,  are  more  likely  to  allow  in-growth  of  squa-\nmous epithelium.\n(b) Metaplasia.

It  \nmay cause destruction of ear ossicles, erosion of bony lab-\nyrinth, canal of facial nerve, sinus plate or tegmen tympa-\nni and thus cause several complications. Bone destruction \nby cholesteatoma has been attributed to various enzymes \nsuch as collagenase, acid phosphatase and proteolytic en-\nzymes, liberated by osteoclasts and mononuclear inflam-\nmatory cells, seen in association with cholesteatoma.

      "content": "SECTION I — Diseases of Ear\n88\nClinical Features\nGradenigo syndrome is the classical presentation, and con-\nsists of a triad of (i) external rectus palsy (VIth nerve pal-\nsy),  (ii)  deep-seated  ear  or  retro-orbital  pain  (Vth  nerve  \ninvolvement)  and  (iii)  persistent  ear  discharge.  It  is  un-\ncommon to see the full triad these days.\nPersistent  ear  discharge  with  or  without  deep-seated  \npain in spite of an adequate cortical or modified radical \nmastoidectomy also points to petrositis.\nFever, headache, vomiting and sometimes neck rigid-\nity may also be associated. Some patients may get facial \nparalysis and recurrent vertigo due to involvement of fa-\ncial and statoacoustic nerves.\nDiagnosis of petrous apicitis requires both CT scan and \nMRI. CT scan of temporal bone will show bony details of \nthe petrous apex and the air cells while MRI helps to dif-\nferentiate diploic marrow-containing apex from the fluid \nor pus.\nTreatment\nCortical,  modified  radical  or  radical  mastoidectomy  is  \noften  required  if  not  already  done.  The  fistulous  tract  \nshould be found out, which is then curetted and enlarged \nto  provide  free  drainage.  Tract  of  posterosuperior  cells  \nstarts in the Trautmann’s triangle or the attic. Tract of an-\nterior cells is situated near the tympanic opening of eus-\ntachian tube and passes above the carotid artery, anterior \nto the cochlea. In the latter case, radical mastoidectomy \nis required.\nSuitable intravenous antibacterial therapy should pre-\ncede and follow surgical intervention. Most cases of acute \npetrositis  can  now  be  cured  with  antibacterial  therapy  \nalone.  It  should  be  given  in  initial  high  doses  and  con-\ntinued for 4-5 days, even after complete disappearance of \nsymptoms.\nC. FACIAL PARALYSIS\nIt can occur as a complication of both acute and chronic \notitis media.\nAcute Otitis Media\nFacial nerve is normally well-protected in its bony canal. \nSometimes, the bony canal is dehiscent and the nerve lies \njust under the middle ear mucosa.

        "SECTION I — Diseases of Ear\n88\nClinical Features\nGradenigo syndrome is the classical presentation, and con-\nsists of a triad of (i) external rectus palsy (VIth nerve pal-\nsy),  (ii)  deep-seated  ear  or  retro-orbital  pain  (Vth  nerve  \ninvolvement)  and  (iii)  persistent  ear  discharge.  It  is  un-\ncommon to see the full triad these days.\nPersistent  ear  discharge  with  or  without  deep-seated  \npain in spite of an adequate cortical or modified radical \nmastoidectomy also points to petrositis.\nFever, headache, vomiting and sometimes neck rigid-\nity may also be associated. Some patients may get facial \nparalysis and recurrent vertigo due to involvement of fa-\ncial and statoacoustic nerves.\nDiagnosis of petrous apicitis requires both CT scan and \nMRI.

In infants and children, otogenic meningitis \nusually follows acute otitis media while in adults it is due \nto chronic middle ear infection.\nMode of Infection\nBlood-borne infection is common in infants and children; \nin adults, it follows chronic ear disease, which spreads by \nbone erosion or retrograde thrombophlebitis. In the latter \ncase,  it  may  be  associated  with  an  extradural  abscess  or  \ngranulation tissue.\nIn one-third of the patients with meningitis, another \nintracranial complication may coexist.\nClinical Features\nSymptoms and signs of meningitis are due to (i) presence \nof infection, (ii) raised intracranial tension, and (iii) me-\nningeal  and  cerebral  irritation.  Their  severity  will  vary  \nwith the extent of disease.\n1.  There  is  rise  in  temperature  (102-104  °F)  often  with  \nchills and rigors.\n2.  Headache.\n3. Neck rigidity.\n4. Photophobia and mental irritability.\n5. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes projectile).\n6. Drowsiness which may progress to delirium or coma.\n7.

CSF is turbid, cell count is raised and may even \nreach 1000/mL with predominance of polymorphs; pro-\ntein level is raised, sugar is reduced and chlorides are di-\nminished.\nCSF is always cultured to find the causative organisms \nand their antibiotic sensitivity.\nTreatment\nmedical.

Abscess is approached through a ster-\nile field. Options include: (i) repeated aspiration through \na  burr  hole,  (ii)  excision  of  abscess  and  (iii)  open  inci-\nsion of the abscess and evacuation of pus. The choice of \nsurgical  procedure  is  left  to  the  judgement  of  the  neu-\nrosurgeon.  If  abscess  is  treated  by  aspiration,  it  should  \nbe  followed  by  repeat  CT  or  MRI  scans  to  see  if  it  di-\nminishes in size. An expanding abscess, or one that does \nnot decrease in size, may require excision. Pus recovered \nfrom  the  abscess  should  be  cultured  and  its  sensitivity  \ndiscovered.  Penicillin  can  be  instilled  into  the  abscess  \nafter aspiration.\notologic. Associated ear disease which caused the brain \nabscess needs attention. Acute otitis media might have re-\nsolved with the antibiotics given for the abscess. Chronic \notitis  media  would  require  radical  mastoidectomy  to  re-\nmove the irreversible disease and to exteriorize the infect-\ned area. Surgery of the ear is undertaken only after the ab-\nscess has been controlled by antibiotics and neurosurgical \ntreatment.\nE. LATERAL SINUS THROMBOPHLEBITIS \n(SYN. SIGMOID SINUS THROMBOSIS)\nIt is an inflammation of inner wall of lateral venous sinus \nwith formation of an intrasinus thrombus.\nAetiology\nIt occurs as a complication of acute coalescent mastoidi-\ntis, masked mastoiditis or chronic suppuration of middle \near and cholesteatoma.\nPathology\nThe pathological process can be divided into the follow-\ning stages:\n1.  Formation oF  perisinus  abscess.  Abscess  forms  in  \nrelation to outer dural wall of the sinus. Overlying bony \ndural plate may have been destroyed by coalescent bone \nerosion  or  cholesteatoma.  Sometimes,  it  remains  intact  \nwhen route of infection was by thrombophlebitic process.\n2. endophlebitis and mural thrombus Formation. \nInflammation  spreads  to  inner  wall  of  the  venous  sinus  \nwith deposition of fibrin, platelets and blood cells leading \nto thrombus formation within the lumen of sinus.\n3. obliteration oF  sinus  lumen and  intrasinus \nabscess.  Mural  thrombus  enlarges  to  occlude  the  sinus  \nlumen completely. Organisms may invade the thrombus \ncausing  intrasinus  abscess  which  may  release  infected  \nemboli into the blood stream causing septicaemia.\n4. extension oF  thrombus.  Though  central  part  of  \nthrombus breaks down due to intrasinus abscess, throm-\nbotic  process  continues  both  proximally  and  distally.  \nProximally,  it  may  spread  to  confluence  of  sinuses  and  \nto superior sagittal sinus or cavernous sinus, and distally, \ninto  mastoid  emissary  vein,  to  jugular  bulb  or  jugular  \nvein.\nBacteriology\nIn  acute  infections,  haemolytic  streptococcus,  pneumo-\ncoccus  or  staphylococcus  are  common.  These  days,  ma-\njority  of  cases  of  thrombophlebitis  are  seen  in  chronic  \ninfection with cholesteatomas, and the organisms found \nare Bacillus  proteus,  Pseudomonas  pyocyaneus,  Escherichia  \ncoli and Staphylococci.\nClinical Features\n1. hectic picket-Fence type oF FeVer with rigors. \nThis is due to septicaemia, often coinciding with release \nof septic emboli into blood stream. Fever is irregular hav-\ning  one  or  more  peaks  a  day.  It  is  usually  accompanied  \nby chills and rigors. Profuse sweating follows fall of tem-\nperature.  Clinical  picture  resembles  malaria  but  lacks  \nregularity.\nIn  between  the  bouts  of  fever,  patient  is  alert  with  a  \nsense of well-being. Patients receiving antibiotics may not \nshow this picture.\n2. headache. In early stage, it may be due to perisinus \nabscess and is mild. Later, it may be severe when intracra-\nnial pressure rises due to venous obstruction.\nFigure 12.7. CT scan of right-sided otogenic cerebral abscess.\nmebooksfree.com",

Abscess is approached through a ster-\nile field. Options include: (i) repeated aspiration through \na  burr  hole,  (ii)  excision  of  abscess  and  (iii)  open  inci-\nsion of the abscess and evacuation of pus. The choice of \nsurgical  procedure  is  left  to  the  judgement  of  the  neu-\nrosurgeon.  If  abscess  is  treated  by  aspiration,  it  should  \nbe  followed  by  repeat  CT  or  MRI  scans  to  see  if  it  di-\nminishes in size. An expanding abscess, or one that does \nnot decrease in size, may require excision. Pus recovered \nfrom  the  abscess  should  be  cultured  and  its  sensitivity  \ndiscovered.

Acute otitis media might have re-\nsolved with the antibiotics given for the abscess. Chronic \notitis  media  would  require  radical  mastoidectomy  to  re-\nmove the irreversible disease and to exteriorize the infect-\ned area. Surgery of the ear is undertaken only after the ab-\nscess has been controlled by antibiotics and neurosurgical \ntreatment.\nE. LATERAL SINUS THROMBOPHLEBITIS \n(SYN. SIGMOID SINUS THROMBOSIS)\nIt is an inflammation of inner wall of lateral venous sinus \nwith formation of an intrasinus thrombus.\nAetiology\nIt occurs as a complication of acute coalescent mastoidi-\ntis, masked mastoiditis or chronic suppuration of middle \near and cholesteatoma.\nPathology\nThe pathological process can be divided into the follow-\ning stages:\n1.

Abscess  forms  in  \nrelation to outer dural wall of the sinus. Overlying bony \ndural plate may have been destroyed by coalescent bone \nerosion  or  cholesteatoma.  Sometimes,  it  remains  intact  \nwhen route of infection was by thrombophlebitic process.\n2. endophlebitis and mural thrombus Formation. \nInflammation  spreads  to  inner  wall  of  the  venous  sinus  \nwith deposition of fibrin, platelets and blood cells leading \nto thrombus formation within the lumen of sinus.\n3. obliteration oF  sinus  lumen and  intrasinus \nabscess.

Fever is irregular hav-\ning  one  or  more  peaks  a  day.  It  is  usually  accompanied  \nby chills and rigors. Profuse sweating follows fall of tem-\nperature.  Clinical  picture  resembles  malaria  but  lacks  \nregularity.\nIn  between  the  bouts  of  fever,  patient  is  alert  with  a  \nsense of well-being. Patients receiving antibiotics may not \nshow this picture.\n2. headache. In early stage, it may be due to perisinus \nabscess and is mild. Later, it may be severe when intracra-\nnial pressure rises due to venous obstruction.\nFigure 12.7. CT scan of right-sided otogenic cerebral abscess.\nmebooksfree.com"

Otospongiosis)\nANATOMY OF LABYRINTH\nIt  may  be  pertinent  to  review  the  anatomy  of  the  laby-\nrinth  and  introduce  the  terminology  often  used  to  de-\nscribe it:\n1. Otic labyrinth. Also called membranous labyrinth or \nendolymphatic labyrinth. It consists of utricle, saccule, \ncochlea,  semicircular  ducts,  endolymphatic  duct  and  \nsac. It is filled with endolymph.\n2. Periotic  labyrinth  or  perilymphatic  labyrinth  (or  \nspace).  It  surrounds  the  otic  labyrinth  and  is  filled  \nwith  perilymph.  It  includes  vestibule,  scala  tympani,  \nscala vestibuli, perilymphatic space of semicircular ca-\nnals and the periotic duct, which surrounds the endo-\nlymphatic duct of otic labyrinth.\n3. Otic  capsule.  It  is  the  bony  labyrinth.  It  has  three  \n layers.\na. Endosteal.  The  innermost  layer.  It  lines  the  bony  \nlabyrinth.\nb. Enchondral. Develops from the cartilage and later os-\nsifies into bone. It is in this layer that some islands \nof cartilage are left unossified that later give rise to \notosclerosis.\nc. Periosteal. Covers the bony labyrinth.\nOtic  capsule  or  the  bony  labyrinth  ossifies  from  14  \ncentres, the first one appears in the region of cochlea at \n16  weeks  and  the  last  one  appears  in  the  posterolateral  \npart of posterior semicircular canal at 20th week.\nOTOSCLEROSIS\nOtosclerosis, more aptly called otospongiosis, is a primary \ndisease  of  the  bony  labyrinth.  In  this,  one  or  more  foci  \nof  irregularly  laid  spongy  bone  replace  part  of  normally  \ndense enchondral layer of bony otic capsule. Most often, \notosclerotic  focus  involves  the  stapes  region  leading  to  \nstapes fixation and conductive deafness. However, it may \ninvolve certain other areas of the bony labyrinth where it \nmay cause neurosensory loss or no symptoms at all.\nAETIOLOGY\nThe exact cause of otosclerosis is not known; however, the \nfollowing facts have been documented.\nAnatomical basis. Bony labyrinth is made of enchondral \nbone  which  is  subject  to  little  change  in  life.  But  some-\ntimes, in this hard bone, there are areas of cartilage rests \nwhich due to certain nonspecific factors are activated to \nform a new spongy bone. One such area is the fissula ante \nfenestram  lying  in  front  of  the  oval  window—the  site  of  \npredilection for stapedial type of otospongiosis.\nHeredity. About 50% of otosclerotics have positive fam-\nily  history;  rest  are  sporadic.  Genetic  studies  reveal  that  \nit  is  an  autosomal  dominant  trait  with  incomplete  pen-\netrance and a variable expressivity.\nRace. White races are affected more than black Ameri-\ncans.  It  is  common  in  Indians  but  rare  among  Chinese  \nand Japanese.\nSex. Females are affected twice as often as males but in \nIndia, otosclerosis seems to predominate in males.\nAge of onset. Hearing loss usually starts between 20 and \n30 years of age and is rare before 10 and after 40 years.\nEffect  of  other  factors.  Hearing  loss  due  to  otosclerosis  \nmay be initiated or made worse by pregnancy. Similarly, \ndeafness  may  increase  during  menopause,  after  an  acci-\ndent or a major operation.\nThe  disease  may  be  associated  with  osteogenesis  im-\nperfecta  with  history  of  multiple  fractures.  The  triad  of  \nsymptoms  of  osteogenesis  imperfecta,  otosclerosis  and  \nblue sclera is called van der Hoeve syndrome. Lesions of otic \ncapsule seen in osteogenesis imperfecta are histologically \nindistinguishable from those of otosclerosis and both are \ndue to genes encoding type I collagen.\nViral  infection.  Electron  microscopic  and  immunohis-\ntochemical  studies  have  shown  RNA  related  to  measles  \nvirus.

Otospongiosis)\nANATOMY OF LABYRINTH\nIt  may  be  pertinent  to  review  the  anatomy  of  the  laby-\nrinth  and  introduce  the  terminology  often  used  to  de-\nscribe it:\n1. Otic labyrinth. Also called membranous labyrinth or \nendolymphatic labyrinth. It consists of utricle, saccule, \ncochlea,  semicircular  ducts,  endolymphatic  duct  and  \nsac. It is filled with endolymph.\n2. Periotic  labyrinth  or  perilymphatic  labyrinth  (or  \nspace).  It  surrounds  the  otic  labyrinth  and  is  filled  \nwith  perilymph.  It  includes  vestibule,  scala  tympani,  \nscala vestibuli, perilymphatic space of semicircular ca-\nnals and the periotic duct, which surrounds the endo-\nlymphatic duct of otic labyrinth.\n3. Otic  capsule.  It  is  the  bony  labyrinth.  It  has  three  \n layers.\na. Endosteal.  The  innermost  layer.  It  lines  the  bony  \nlabyrinth.\nb. Enchondral.

It is in this layer that some islands \nof cartilage are left unossified that later give rise to \notosclerosis.\nc. Periosteal. Covers the bony labyrinth.\nOtic  capsule  or  the  bony  labyrinth  ossifies  from  14  \ncentres, the first one appears in the region of cochlea at \n16  weeks  and  the  last  one  appears  in  the  posterolateral  \npart of posterior semicircular canal at 20th week.\nOTOSCLEROSIS\nOtosclerosis, more aptly called otospongiosis, is a primary \ndisease  of  the  bony  labyrinth.  In  this,  one  or  more  foci  \nof  irregularly  laid  spongy  bone  replace  part  of  normally  \ndense enchondral layer of bony otic capsule.

However, it may \ninvolve certain other areas of the bony labyrinth where it \nmay cause neurosensory loss or no symptoms at all.\nAETIOLOGY\nThe exact cause of otosclerosis is not known; however, the \nfollowing facts have been documented.\nAnatomical basis. Bony labyrinth is made of enchondral \nbone  which  is  subject  to  little  change  in  life.  But  some-\ntimes, in this hard bone, there are areas of cartilage rests \nwhich due to certain nonspecific factors are activated to \nform a new spongy bone. One such area is the fissula ante \nfenestram  lying  in  front  of  the  oval  window—the  site  of  \npredilection for stapedial type of otospongiosis.\nHeredity. About 50% of otosclerotics have positive fam-\nily  history;  rest  are  sporadic.  Genetic  studies  reveal  that",

Genetic  studies  reveal  that  \nit  is  an  autosomal  dominant  trait  with  incomplete  pen-\netrance and a variable expressivity.\nRace. White races are affected more than black Ameri-\ncans.  It  is  common  in  Indians  but  rare  among  Chinese  \nand Japanese.\nSex. Females are affected twice as often as males but in \nIndia, otosclerosis seems to predominate in males.\nAge of onset. Hearing loss usually starts between 20 and \n30 years of age and is rare before 10 and after 40 years.\nEffect  of  other  factors.  Hearing  loss  due  to  otosclerosis  \nmay be initiated or made worse by pregnancy. Similarly, \ndeafness  may  increase  during  menopause,  after  an  acci-\ndent or a major operation.\nThe  disease  may  be  associated  with  osteogenesis  im-\nperfecta  with  history  of  multiple  fractures.

The  triad  of  \nsymptoms  of  osteogenesis  imperfecta,  otosclerosis  and  \nblue sclera is called van der Hoeve syndrome. Lesions of otic \ncapsule seen in osteogenesis imperfecta are histologically \nindistinguishable from those of otosclerosis and both are \ndue to genes encoding type I collagen.\nViral  infection.  Electron  microscopic  and  immunohis-\ntochemical  studies  have  shown  RNA  related  to  measles  \nvirus. It is likely that otosclerosis is a viral disease as has \nbeen suggested for Paget’s disease.\nTYPES OF OTOSCLEROSIS\n1. stapedial otosclerosis.

It is a mixed nerve \nhaving motor and a sensory root. The latter is also called \nthe  nerve  of  Wrisberg  and  carries  secretomotor  fibres  to  \nthe lacrimal gland and salivary glands, and brings fibres \nof  taste  and  general  sensation.  Thus  there  are  two  effer-\nent and two afferent pathways. Components of the facial \nnerve include:\n1. Special  visceral  efferent  forms  the  motor  root  and  \nsupplies  all  the  muscles  derived  from  the  second  \nbranchial arch, i.e. all the muscles of facial expression, \nauricular muscles (now vestigial), stylohyoid, posterior \nbelly of digastric and the stapedius.\n2. General visceral efferent supplies secretomotor fibres \nto lacrimal, submandibular and sublingual glands and \nthe  smaller  secretory  glands  in  the  nasal  mucosa  and  \nthe palate.\n3. Special visceral afferent brings taste from the anterior \ntwo-thirds of tongue via chorda tympani and soft and \nhard palate via greater superficial petrosal nerve. Taste \nis carried to the nucleus of tractus solitarius.\n4. General  somatic  afferent  brings  general  sensation  \nfrom  the  concha,  posterosuperior  part  of  external  ca-\nnal and the tympanic membrane. These fibres account \nfor vesicular eruption in herpes zoster infection of the \ngeniculate ganglion. It also brings proprioceptive sen-\nsation from the facial muscles.\nNUCLEUS OF FACIAL NERVE\nMotor nucleus of the nerve is situated in the pons. It re-\nceives fibres from the precentral gyrus. Upper part of the \nnucleus which innervates forehead muscles receives fibres \nfrom both the cerebral hemispheres, while the lower part \nof  nucleus  which  supplies  lower  face  gets  only  crossed  \nfibres  from  one  hemisphere.  The  function  of  forehead  \nis  preserved  in  supranuclear  lesions  because  of  bilateral  \ninnervation.  Facial  nucleus  also  receives  fibres  from  the  \nthalamus  by  alternate  routes  and  provides  involuntary  \ncontrol  to  facial  muscles.  The  emotional  movements  \nsuch  as  smiling  and  crying  are  thus  preserved  in  supra-\nnuclear palsies because of these fibres from the thalamus \n(Figure 14.1).\nCOURSE OF FACIAL NERVE\nMotor fibres take origin from the nucleus of VIIth nerve, \nhook round the nucleus of VIth nerve and are joined by \nthe sensory root (nerve of Wrisberg). Facial nerve leaves the \nbrainstem  at  pontomedullary  junction,  travels  through  \nposterior  cranial  fossa  and  enters  the  internal  acoustic  \nmeatus. At the fundus of the meatus (lateral most part of \nmeatus), the nerve enters the bony facial canal, traverses \nthe temporal bone and comes out of the stylomastoid fo-\nramen. Here it crosses the styloid process and divides into \nterminal branches. The course of the nerve (Figure 14.2) \ncan thus be divided into three parts.\n1.  intracranial Part. From pons to internal acoustic \nmeatus (15–17 mm).\n2.  intratemporal Part.  From  internal  acoustic  mea-\ntus to stylomastoid foramen. It is further divided into:\n(a) Meatal  segment  (8–10  mm).  Within  internal  acoustic  \nmeatus.\n(b) Labyrinthine segment (4.0 mm). From fundus of mea-\ntus  to  the  geniculate  ganglion  where  nerve  takes  a  \nturn posteriorly forming a “genu.” The nerve in the \nlabyrinthine  segment  has  the  narrowest  diameter  \n(0.61–0.68 mm) and the bony canal in this segment \nis also the narrowest. Thus oedema or inflammation \ncan  easily  compress  the  nerve  and  cause  paralysis.  \nThis is also the shortest segment of the nerve.\n(c) Tympanic or horizontal segment (11.0 mm). From genic-\nulate ganglion to just above the pyramidal eminence. \nIt  lies  above  the  oval  window  and  below  the  lateral  \nsemicircular canal.\n(d) Mastoid or vertical segment (13.0 mm). From the pyra-\nmid to stylomastoid foramen. Between the tympan-\nic  and  mastoid  segments  is  the  second  genu  of  the  \nnerve.\n3.  extracranial Part.

Risk  of  Bell  palsy  is  \nmore in diabetics (angiopathy) and pregnant women (re-\ntention of fluid).\naetiology\n1.  viraL InFection. Most of the evidence supports the \nviral aetiology due to herpes simplex, herpes zoster or the \nEpstein–Barr  virus.  Other  cranial  nerves  may  also  be  in-\nvolved in Bell palsy which is thus considered a part of the \ntotal picture of polyneuropathy.\n2.  vaScuLar ISchaeMia. It may be primary or second-\nary. Primary  ischaemia  is  induced  by  cold  or  emotional  \nstress. Secondary ischaemia is the result of primary ischae-\nmia  which  causes  increased  capillary  permeability  lead-\ning  to  exudation  of  fluid,  oedema  and  compression  of  \nmicrocirculation of the nerve.\n3.    hereDitary. The fallopian canal is narrow because of \nhereditary predisposition and this makes the nerve suscepti-\nble to early compression with the slightest oedema. Ten per \ncent of the cases of Bell palsy have a positive family history.\n4.    autoiMMune DiSorDer. T-lymphocyte changes have \nbeen observed.\nclinical  Features  (Figures  14.7 and  14.8  A,B ). \nOnset is sudden. Patient is unable to close his eye. On at-\ntempting to close the eye, eyeball turns up and out (Bell \nphenomenon). Saliva dribbles from the angle of mouth. \nFace  becomes  asymmetrical.  Tears  flow  down  from  the  \neye (epiphora). Pain in the ear may precede or accompany \nthe nerve paralysis. Some complain of noise intolerance \n(stapedial paralysis) or loss of taste (involvement of chor-\nda  tympani).

Most of the evidence supports the \nviral aetiology due to herpes simplex, herpes zoster or the \nEpstein–Barr  virus.

Primary  ischaemia  is  induced  by  cold  or  emotional  \nstress. Secondary ischaemia is the result of primary ischae-\nmia  which  causes  increased  capillary  permeability  lead-\ning  to  exudation  of  fluid,  oedema  and  compression  of  \nmicrocirculation of the nerve.\n3.    hereDitary.

Parotid Surgery and Trauma to Face\nFacial nerve may be injured in surgery of parotid tumours \nor deliberately excised in malignant tumours. Accidental \ninjuries in the parotid region can also cause facial paraly-\nsis.  Application  of  obstetrical  forceps  may  also  result  in  \nfacial paralysis in the neonate due to pressure on the ex-\ntratemporal part of nerve.\nD. NEOPLASMS\n1. Intratemporal Neoplasms\nCarcinoma  of  external  or  middle  ear,  glomus  tumour,  \nrhabdomyosarcoma and metastatic tumours of temporal \nbone,  all  result  in  facial  paralysis.  Facial  nerve  neuroma  \noccurs anywhere along the course of nerve and produces \nparalysis  of  gradual  or  sudden  onset.  It  is  treated  by  ex-\ncision  and  nerve  grafting.  High-resolution  CT  scan  and  \ngadolinium-enhanced MRI is very useful for facial nerve \ntumour.\n2. Tumours of Parotid\nFacial paralysis with tumour of the parotid almost always \nimplies malignancy (see Tumours of salivary glands).\nE. SYSTEMIC DISEASES AND FACIAL \nPARALYSIS\nPeripheral facial paralysis is mostly of idiopathic variety but \nalways  needs  exclusion  of  diabetes,  hypothyroidism,  leu-\nkaemia, sarcoidosis, periarteritis nodosa, Wegener’s granu-\nlomatosis, leprosy, syphilis and demyelinating disease.\nLOCALIZATION OF FACIAL LESION\nA. CENTRAL FACIAL PARALYSIS\nIt  is  caused  by  cerebrovascular  accidents  (haemorrhage,  \nthrombosis or embolism), tumour or an abscess. It causes \nparalysis of only the lower half of face on the contralat-\neral side. Forehead movements are retained due to bilat-\neral  innervation  of  frontalis  muscle.  Involuntary  emo-\ntional movements and the tone of facial muscles are also \nretained.\nB. PERIPHERAL FACIAL PARALYSIS\nAll the muscles of the face on the involved side are para-\nlyzed. Patient is unable to frown, close the eye, purse the \nlips or whistle.\nA lesion at the level of nucleus is identified by associated \nparalysis of VIth nerve.\nA lesion at cerebellopontine angle is identified by the pres-\nence of vestibular and auditory defects and involvement \nof other cranial nerves such as Vth, IXth, Xth and XIth.\nA lesion in the bony canal, from internal acoustic meatus \nto  stylomastoid  foramen,  can  be  localized  by  topodiag-\nnostic tests.\nA  lesion  outside  the  temporal  bone,  in  the  parotid  area,  \naffects only the motor functions of nerve. It may some-\ntimes be incomplete as some branches of the nerve may \nnot be involved in tumour or trauma.\nTOPODIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR LESIONS IN \nINTRATEMPORAL PART (FIGURE 14.12 )\nThe following tests are useful in finding the site of lesion \nin paralysis of lower motor neuron.\n1.  schirmer Test.  It  compares  lacrimation  of  the  two  \nsides.

It is characterized by \n(i) vertigo, (ii) sensorineural hearing loss, (iii) tinnitus and \n(iv) aural fullness.\nPATHOLOGY\nThe main pathology is distension of endolymphatic sys-\ntem,  mainly  affecting  the  cochlear  duct  (scala  media)  \nand  the  saccule,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  utricle  and  \nsemicircular  canals.  The  dilatation  of  cochlear  duct  is  \nsuch that it may completely fill the scala vestibuli; there \nis  marked  bulging  of  Reissner’s  membrane,  which  may  \neven  herniate  through  the  helicotrema  into  the  apical  \npart  of  scala  tympani  (Figure  15.1).  The  distended  sac-\ncule  may  come  to  lie  against  the  stapes  footplate.  The  \nutricle  and  saccule  may  show  outpouchings  into  the  \nsemicircular canals.\nAETIOLOGY\nThe main pathology in Ménière’s disease is distension of \nendolymphatic system due to increased volume of endo-\nlymph. This can result either from increased production \nof endolymph or its faulty absorption or both.

        "111\nChapter 15\nMénière’s Disease\nMénière’s  disease,  also  called  endolymphatic  hydrops,  is  a  \ndisorder  of  the  inner  ear  where  the  endolymphatic  sys-\ntem is distended with endolymph. It is characterized by \n(i) vertigo, (ii) sensorineural hearing loss, (iii) tinnitus and \n(iv) aural fullness.\nPATHOLOGY\nThe main pathology is distension of endolymphatic sys-\ntem,  mainly  affecting  the  cochlear  duct  (scala  media)  \nand  the  saccule,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  utricle  and  \nsemicircular  canals.  The  dilatation  of  cochlear  duct  is  \nsuch that it may completely fill the scala vestibuli; there \nis  marked  bulging  of  Reissner’s  membrane,  which  may  \neven  herniate  through  the  helicotrema  into  the  apical  \npart  of  scala  tympani  (Figure  15.1).  The  distended  sac-\ncule  may  come  to  lie  against  the  stapes  footplate.  The  \nutricle  and  saccule  may  show  outpouchings  into  the  \nsemicircular canals.\nAETIOLOGY",

The  \nutricle  and  saccule  may  show  outpouchings  into  the  \nsemicircular canals.\nAETIOLOGY\nThe main pathology in Ménière’s disease is distension of \nendolymphatic system due to increased volume of endo-\nlymph. This can result either from increased production \nof endolymph or its faulty absorption or both. Normally, \nendolymph is secreted by stria vascularis, fills the mem-\nbranous labyrinth and is absorbed through the endolym-\nphatic sac (see p. 11 for inner ear fluids).\nThe exact cause of Ménière’s disease is not yet known. \nVarious theories have been postulated (Figure 15.2).\n1.  deFectiVe Absorption by Endolymphatic Sac. \nNormally,  endolymph  is  carried  by  the  endolymphatic  \nduct  to  the  sac  where  it  is  absorbed.

MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PHASE\nWhen  patient  presents  after  the  acute  attack,  the  treat-\nment consists of:\n1. Vestibular    sedatives.    Prochlorperazine    (Stemetil)    \n10  mg,  thrice  a  day,  orally  for  two  months  and  then  \nreduced to 5 mg thrice a day for another month.\n2. Vasodilators.  Betahistine  (Vertin)  8–16  mg,  thrice  \na  day,  given  orally,  also  increases  labyrinthine  blood  \nflow by releasing histamine in the body.\n3. Diuretics.  Sometimes,  diuretic  furosemide,  40  mg  \ntablet, taken on alternate days with potassium supple-\nment  helps  to  control  recurrent  attacks,  if  not  con-\ntrolled  by  vasodilators  or  vestibular  sedatives.

However,  they  are  not  \npreferred by many due to side effects.\n5. Elimination of allergen. Sometimes, a food or inhal-\nant allergen is responsible for such attacks.

They  are  used  in  cases  \nwhere  vertigo  is  disabling  but  hearing  is  still  useful  and  \nneeds to be preserved. They are:\n(a) Decompression of endolymphatic sac.\n(b) Endolymphatic shunt operation. A tube is put, connect-\ning  endolymphatic  sac  with  subarachnoid  space,  to  \ndrain excess endolymph.\n(c) Sacculotomy  (Fick’s  operation).  It  is  puncturing  the  \nsaccule with a needle through stapes footplate. A dis-\ntended saccule lies close to stapes footplate and can \nbe  easily  penetrated.  Cody’s  tack  procedure  consists  \nof  placing  a  stainless  steel  tack  through  the  stapes  \nfootplate. The tack would cause periodic decompres-\nsion of the saccule when it gets distended. Both these \noperations were claimed to have shown good results \nbut they could not be reproduced by others and thus \nabandoned.  Cochleosacculotomy  is  another  similar  \nprocedure in which, instead of saccule, cochlear duct \nis  punctured  and  drained  into  the  perilymph  (otic-\nperiotic  shunt).  The  procedure  is  performed  with  a  \ncurved needle passed through the round window to \npuncture cochlear duct.\n(d) Section of vestibular nerve. The nerve is exposed by ret-\nrosigmoid  or  middle  cranial  fossa  approach  and  se-\nlectively  sectioned.

A prerequisite for such a therapy \nis  to  perform  a  myringotomy  and  insert  a  ventilation  \ntube so that the device when coupled to the external ear \ncanal  can  deliver  pressure  waves  to  the  round  window  \nmembrane  via  the  ventilation  tube.

The latter resemble carotid body in structure and \nare found in the dome of jugular bulb or on the promon-\ntory along the course of tympanic branch of IXth cranial \nnerve (Jacobson’s nerve).

Microscopically,  it  consists  of  \nelongated  spindle  cells  with  rod-shaped  nuclei  lying  in  \nrows  or  palisades.  Bilateral  tumours  are  seen  in  patients  \nwith neurofibromatosis.\nORIGIN AND GROWTH OF TUMOUR\nThe tumour almost always arises from the Schwann cells of \nthe vestibular, but rarely from the cochlear division of VIIIth \nnerve within the internal auditory canal (Figure 18.1). As it \nexpands, it causes widening and erosion of the canal and \nthen  appears  in  the  cerebellopontine  angle.  Here,  it  may  \ngrow  anterosuperiorly  to  involve  Vth  nerve  or  inferiorly  \nto involve the IXth, Xth and XIth cranial nerves. In later \nstages,  it  causes  displacement  of  brainstem,  pressure  on  \ncerebellum  and  raised  intracranial  tension  (Figure  18.2). \nThe growth of the tumour is extremely slow and the his-\ntory may extend over several years.\nCLASSIFICATION\nDepending on the size, the tumour is classified as:\n1.

They  are  grouped  \nunder the following heads (Table 19.2):\n1. screening  procedures.  They  are  employed  to  test  \nhearing  in  “high-risk”  infants  and  are  based  on  infant’s  \nbehavioural  response  to  the  sound  signal.  It  is  now  ob-\nserved that 95% of children with one or more risk factors \nhave  normal  hearing.  On  the  contrary,  50%  of  children  \nwith  sensorineural  hearing  loss  had  no  risk  factor.  This  \nleads to a programme of universal neonatal screening for \nearly detection.\nTwo important tests are to study otoacoustic emissions \n(OAEs) and auditory brainstem responses (ABR).\n(a)  OAEs  are  generated  at  outer  hair  cells  and  can  be  \npicked  up  from  the  external  ear  as  the  energy  pro-\nduced by them travels in reverse direction from outer \nhair  cells  →  ossicles  →  tympanic  membrane  →  ear  \ncanal where it is picked up. OAEs are absent if outer \nhair cells in the cochlea are nonfunctional or there is \nmiddle ear effusion or canal debris due to meconium \nwhich may persist for 3–4 days. They are normal even \nwhen VIIIth nerve is nonfunctional. Thus can be used \nin the diagnosis of neuropathy of VIIIth nerve.\n(b) ABRs are generated in response to sound stimulus pre-\nsented to the ear and picked up from the scalp.

It can screen babies with moderate, severe or pro-\nfound hearing loss.\n2. behaViour obserVation audiometry. Auditory sig-\nnal  presented  to  an  infant  produces  a  change  in  behav-\niour,  e.g.  alerting,  cessation  of  an  activity,  widening  of  \neyes or facial grimacing. Moro’s reflex is one of them and \nconsists of sudden movement of limbs and extension of \nhead in response to sound of 80–90 dB. In cochleopalpebral \nreflex, the child responds by a blink to a loud sound. In \ncessation reflex, an infant stops activity or starts crying in \nresponse to a sound of 90 dB.\n3. distraction   techniques.   are   used   in   children   \n6–7  months  old.  The  child  at  this  age  turns  his  head  to  \nlocate the source of sound. In this test, the child is seated \nin his mother’s lap, an assistant distracts the child’s atten-\ntion while the examiner produces a sound from behind or \nfrom one side to see if the child tries to locate it. Sounds \nused  are  high  frequency  rattle  (8  kHz),  low-frequency  \nhum,  whispered  sound  as  “S,  S,  S”,  xylophone,  warbled  \ntones or narrow band noise (500–4000 Hz).\n4. conditioning techniques\n(a) Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA). It is a condition-\ning technique in which child is trained to look for an \nauditory stimulus by turning his head. This behaviour \nis  reinforced  by  a  flashing  light  or  an  animated  toy.  \nThis test helps to determine the hearing threshold us-\ning  standard  audiometric  techniques.  The  auditory  \nstimulus is delivered by headphones or better still by \ninsert  earphones  which  are  accepted  better  and  are  \nalso  light  weight.  Test  is  well-suited  between  the  de-\nvelopmental age of 6 months to 2 years.\n(b) Play  audiometry.  The  child  is  conditioned  to  perform  \nan act such as placing a marble in a box, putting a ring \non  a  post  or  putting  a  plastic  block  in  a  bucket  each  \ntime he hears a sound signal. Each correct performance \nof the act is reinforced with praise, encouragement or \nreward.  Ear  specific  thresholds  can  be  determined  by  \nstandard audiometric techniques. This test can be used \nin children with developmental age of 2–4 or 5 years.\n(c) Speech  audiometry.

HEARING AIDS\nConventional Hearing Aids\nA hearing aid is a device to amplify sounds reaching the \near. Essentially, it consists of three parts: (i) a microphone, \nwhich  picks  up  sounds  and  converts  them  into  electri-\ncal  impulses,  (ii)  an  amplifier,  which  magnifies  electrical  \nimpulses and (iii) a receiver, which converts electrical im-\npulses back to sound. This amplified sound is then carried \nthrough the earmould to the tympanic membrane.\ntypes oF hearing aids\nair  conDuction  hearing  aiD.  In  this,  the  amplified  \nsound  is  transmitted  via  the  ear  canal  to  the  tympanic  \nmembrane.\nBone conDuction hearing aiD. Instead of a receiver, \nit  has  a  bone  vibrator  which  snugly  fits  on  the  mastoid  \nand  directly  stimulates  the  cochlea.  This  type  of  aid  is  \nespecially  useful  in  persons  with  actively  draining  ears,  \notitis externa or atresia of the ear canal when ear inserts \ncannot be worn.\nMost of the aids are air conduction type. They can be:\n1. Body-worn types. Most common type (Figure 20.1A );  \nmicrophone  and  amplifier  along  with  the  battery  are  \nin  one  case  worn  at  the  chest  level  while  receiver  is  \nsituated  at  the  ear  level.  This  type  of  aid  allows  high  \ndegree  of  amplification  with  minimal  feedback.  It  is  \nuseful  in  severely  deaf  persons  or  children  with  con-\ngenital deafness.\n2. Behind-the-ear  (BTE)  types.  Here  microphone,  am-\nplifier,  receiver  and  battery  are  all  in  one  unit  which  \nis  worn  behind  the  ear.  It  is  coupled  to  the  ear  canal  \nwith  a  tubing  and  an  earmould.  It  is  useful  for  slight  \nto moderate cases of hearing loss particularly the high \nfrequency ones.\n3. Spectacle  types.  It  is  a  modification  of  the  “behind-\nthe-ear”  type  and  the  unit  is  housed  in  the  auricular  \npart of the spectacle frame. It is useful to persons who \nneed both eye glasses for vision and a hearing aid. It is \nnot very popular now.\n4. In-the-ear  (ITE)  types.  The  entire  hearing  aid  is  \nhoused in an earmould which can be worn in the ear. \nIt is useful for mild to moderate hearing losses with flat \nconfiguration. They are very popular because of their \ncosmetic appeal.\n5. Canal types (ITC and CIC). The hearing aid is so small \nthat the entire aid can be worn in the ear canal with-\nout projecting into the concha. For using this aid, it is \nrequired that the ear canal should be large and wide, \nand  patient  should  have  the  dexterity  to  manipulate  \nthe  minute  controls  in  the  aid.  It  is  useful  for  mild  \nto  moderate  cases  of  hearing  loss  of  high  frequency  \n(1–4 kHz).\nTwo types are available: in the canal (ITC) and another \nstill  smaller  and  invisible  type,  completely  in  the  canal  \n(CIC).\nindications For hearing aid. Any individual who has \na  hearing  problem  that  cannot  be  helped  by  medical  or  \nsurgical means is a candidate for hearing aid.\n1. Sensorineural hearing loss, which interferes with day-\nto-day activities of a person. Hearing aid may not suit \nall such persons because of the intolerable distortion of \nsound in some, particularly in those with recruitment.\n2. Deaf children should be fitted with hearing aid as ear-\nly as possible for development of speech and learning. \nIn  severely  deaf  children,  binaural  aids  (one  for  each  \near  and  individually  fitted)  are  more  useful.  Training  \nin lip reading is given simultaneously.\n3. Conductive  deafness.  Most  of  such  persons  can  be  \nhelped by surgery but hearing aid is prescribed when \nsurgery is refused or not feasible or has failed.\nFitting a  hearing  aid.  While  fitting  a  hearing  aid,  \nconsideration is given to:\n1. Degree of hearing loss.\n2. Configuration of hearing loss (type of frequencies af-\nfected).\n3. Type of hearing loss (conductive or sensorineural).\n4. Presence of recruitment.\n5. Uncomfortable loudness level.\n6. Age and dexterity of patient.\n7. Condition of the outer and middle ear.\n8.

Appropriate  candidates  for  di-\nrect drive middle ear hearing devices include adults aged \n18 years and older with moderate-to-severe sensorineural \nhearing loss.

Other  problems  these  patients  feel  with  these  \naids are discomfort due to the occlusion effect of the ca-\nnal, wax occluding hearing aid mould and wax impaction \nof the external auditory canal, inability to wear traditional \nhearing aids due to sensitive ear canal skin and the inabil-\nity to overcome acoustic feedback issues (see Table 20.2 for \ndisadvantages of conventional hearing aids).\nProceDure. The internal device is surgically implant-\ned. The procedure is conducted under general anaesthe-\nsia.  The  receiver  of  the  implant  is  positioned  under  the  \nskin  over  the  mastoid  bone  via  a  standard  cortical  mas-\ntoidectomy  and  posterior  tympanotomy  approach;  the  \nossicular  chain  is  visualized  and  the  FMT  is  attached  to  \nthe  long  process  of  the  incus.  The  middle  ear  structures  \nare not modified. Therefore, there is no significant impact \non the residual hearing of the patient.\nSix  to  eight  weeks  after  the  procedure,  the  patient  is  \nfitted  with  the  external  audio  processor  that  attaches  \nmagnetically to the back of the ear. The processor is then \nprogrammed.\naDvantageS. A direct drive system provides mechani-\ncal  energy  directly  to  the  ossicles,  bypassing  the  ear  ca-\nnal and the tympanic membrane. This eliminates many \nof the inherent issues of conventional hearing aids such \nas occlusion, feedback, discomfort and wax related prob-\nlems. One major advantage of direct drive devices is the \nability to provide improved sound quality to the hearing-\nimpaired subjects particularly in noisy environments.\nB. IMPLANTS\nCochlear Implants\nA cochlear implant is an electronic device that can provide \nuseful hearing and improved communication abilities for \npersons who have severe to profound sensorineural hear-\ning loss and who cannot benefit from hearing aids.\nA  cochlear  implant  works  by  producing  meaningful  \nelectrical stimulation of the auditory nerve where degen-\neration of the hair cells in the cochlea has progressed to a \npoint such that amplification provided by hearing aids is \nno longer effective.

The  receiver  of  the  implant  is  positioned  under  the  \nskin  over  the  mastoid  bone  via  a  standard  cortical  mas-\ntoidectomy  and  posterior  tympanotomy  approach;  the  \nossicular  chain  is  visualized  and  the  FMT  is  attached  to  \nthe  long  process  of  the  incus.

This eliminates many \nof the inherent issues of conventional hearing aids such \nas occlusion, feedback, discomfort and wax related prob-\nlems. One major advantage of direct drive devices is the \nability to provide improved sound quality to the hearing-\nimpaired subjects particularly in noisy environments.\nB.

        "Cochlear Implants\nA cochlear implant is an electronic device that can provide \nuseful hearing and improved communication abilities for \npersons who have severe to profound sensorineural hear-\ning loss and who cannot benefit from hearing aids.\nA  cochlear  implant  works  by  producing  meaningful  \nelectrical stimulation of the auditory nerve where degen-\neration of the hair cells in the cochlea has progressed to a \npoint such that amplification provided by hearing aids is \nno longer effective.

These \ndevices can thus be divided into three groups:\n1. Assistive Listening Devices and Systems\nThey  are  not  hearing  aids  but  devices  which  help  the  \nhearing  impaired  to  listen  efficiently  in  the  presence  of  \nbackground noise, over the telephone, in auditoriums or \ntheatres. They may be used by the person individually or \nare meant for a group.\nAccording to the technology used, they are grouped as \nhard-wired system, induction loops, AM (amplitude mod-\nulation), FM (frequency modulation) or infrared signals.\n2. Alerting Devices\nA hearing-impaired person may not hear a telephone or a \ndoorbell, a baby crying in another room, an alarm clock \nor the noise of a smoke detector. Alerting devices are use-\nful in such situations. They produce an extra loud sound \nsignal or relay the signal to an area closer to the individ-\nual. A “hearing dog” is one such simple device. The dog \nis trained to bark loudly at the sound of a doorbell or cry \nof a baby to alert his master. It is a helpful companion for \nthe hearing impaired.\nFor  people  with  severe  to  profound  or  total  deafness,  \neven these devices which produce extra loud sound may \nnot be useful. They need assistive signalling devices where \nthe  sound  (as  of  doorbell,  telephone,  alarm  clock,  baby  \ncrying) is changed into a light signal or vibrations. Alarm \nclock with flashing lights or those devices which produce \nstrong vibrations to awaken the individual or even shake \nhis bed are also available.\n3. Telecommunication Devices\nA telephone amplifier can be attached to the hand set of \na telephone, residential or public, to amplify the sound. \nA telephone coupler is a device that can be connected to \nthe telephone and the signal produced is picked up by the \nhearing aid.\nFor the profoundly or totally deaf individuals, telecom-\nmunication devices for the deaf (TDDs) can be used. They \nconvert typed message into sounds that can be transmit-\nted  over  the  standard  telephone  lines,  and  at  the  other  \nend another TDD converts these sound signals back into \ntypewritten  messages.

Usually, it is unilateral but may also affect both ears. \nIt may vary in pitch and loudness and has been variously \ndescribed by the patient as roaring, hissing, swishing, rus-\ntling or clicking type of noise. Tinnitus is more annoying in \nquiet  surroundings,  particularly  at  night,  when  the  mask-\ning effect of ambient noise from the environment is lost.\nTYPES OF TINNITUS\nTwo types of tinnitus are described:\n1. Subjective, which can only be heard by the patient.\n2.  Objective,  which  can  even  be  heard  by  the  examiner  \nwith the use of a stethoscope.\nCAUSES OF TINNITUS (TABLE 22.1)\nSubjective tinnitus may have its origin in the external ear, \nmiddle ear, inner ear, VIIIth nerve or the central nervous \nsystem.  Systemic  disorders  like  anaemia,  arteriosclerosis,  \nhypertension and certain drugs may act through the inner \near  or  central  auditory  pathways.  In  the  presence  of  con-\nductive hearing loss, the patient may hear abnormal noises \nin the head during eating, speaking or even respiration.\nObjective  tinnitus  is  seen  less  frequently.  Vascular  \nlesions,  e.g.  glomus  tumour  or  carotid  artery  aneurysm  \ncause  swishing  tinnitus  synchronous  with  pulse.  It  can  \nbe temporarily abolished by pressure on the common ca-\nrotid  artery.  Venous  hum  can  sometimes  be  stopped  by  \npressure on the neck veins.\nTinnitus synchronous with respiration may occur due \nto abnormally patent eustachian tube. Palatal myoclonus \nproduces clicking sound due to clonic contraction of the \nmuscles of soft palate and can be easily diagnosed. Clonic \ncontraction of muscles of middle ear (stapedius and ten-\nsor tympani) may cause tinnitus which is often difficult \nto diagnose.\nSometimes, tinnitus is psychogenic and no cause can \nbe found in the ear or central nervous system.\nTinnitus should be differentiated from auditory hallu-\ncinations in which a person hears voices or other organ-\nized  sounds  like  that  of  music.  It  is  seen  in  psychiatric  \ndisorders.\nTREATMENT OF TINNITUS\nTinnitus is a symptom and not a disease. Where possible, \nits  cause  should  be  discovered  and  treated.  Sometimes,  \neven  the  treatment  of  cause  may  not  alleviate  tinnitus.  \nWhen  no  cause  is  found,  management  of  tinnitus  in-\ncludes:\n1. Reassurance and psychotherapy. Many times the patient \nhas to learn to live with tinnitus.\n2. Techniques of relaxation and biofeedback.\n3. Sedation and tranquillizers.

        "145\nChapter 22\nTinnitus\nTinnitus is ringing sound or noise in the ear. The character-\nistic feature is that the origin of this sound is within the pa-\ntient. Usually, it is unilateral but may also affect both ears. \nIt may vary in pitch and loudness and has been variously \ndescribed by the patient as roaring, hissing, swishing, rus-\ntling or clicking type of noise. Tinnitus is more annoying in \nquiet  surroundings,  particularly  at  night,  when  the  mask-\ning effect of ambient noise from the environment is lost.\nTYPES OF TINNITUS\nTwo types of tinnitus are described:\n1. Subjective, which can only be heard by the patient.\n2.  Objective,  which  can  even  be  heard  by  the  examiner  \nwith the use of a stethoscope.\nCAUSES OF TINNITUS (TABLE 22.1)\nSubjective tinnitus may have its origin in the external ear, \nmiddle ear, inner ear, VIIIth nerve or the central nervous \nsystem.

        "Subjective tinnitus may have its origin in the external ear, \nmiddle ear, inner ear, VIIIth nerve or the central nervous \nsystem.  Systemic  disorders  like  anaemia,  arteriosclerosis,  \nhypertension and certain drugs may act through the inner \near  or  central  auditory  pathways.  In  the  presence  of  con-\nductive hearing loss, the patient may hear abnormal noises \nin the head during eating, speaking or even respiration.\nObjective  tinnitus  is  seen  less  frequently.  Vascular  \nlesions,  e.g.  glomus  tumour  or  carotid  artery  aneurysm  \ncause  swishing  tinnitus  synchronous  with  pulse.  It  can  \nbe temporarily abolished by pressure on the common ca-\nrotid  artery.  Venous  hum  can  sometimes  be  stopped  by  \npressure on the neck veins.\nTinnitus synchronous with respiration may occur due \nto abnormally patent eustachian tube. Palatal myoclonus \nproduces clicking sound due to clonic contraction of the \nmuscles of soft palate and can be easily diagnosed. Clonic",
        "to abnormally patent eustachian tube. Palatal myoclonus \nproduces clicking sound due to clonic contraction of the \nmuscles of soft palate and can be easily diagnosed. Clonic \ncontraction of muscles of middle ear (stapedius and ten-\nsor tympani) may cause tinnitus which is often difficult \nto diagnose.\nSometimes, tinnitus is psychogenic and no cause can \nbe found in the ear or central nervous system.\nTinnitus should be differentiated from auditory hallu-\ncinations in which a person hears voices or other organ-\nized  sounds  like  that  of  music.  It  is  seen  in  psychiatric  \ndisorders.\nTREATMENT OF TINNITUS\nTinnitus is a symptom and not a disease. Where possible, \nits  cause  should  be  discovered  and  treated.  Sometimes,  \neven  the  treatment  of  cause  may  not  alleviate  tinnitus.  \nWhen  no  cause  is  found,  management  of  tinnitus  in-\ncludes:\n1. Reassurance and psychotherapy.

Nasal pyramid consists of \nosteocartilaginous  framework  covered  by  muscles  and  \nskin.\nOSTEOCARTILAGINOUS FRAMEWORK\nBony Part\nUpper one-third of the external nose is bony while lower \ntwo-thirds  are  cartilaginous.  The  bony  part  consists  of  \ntwo nasal bones which meet in the midline and rest on \nthe  upper  part  of  the  nasal  process  of  the  frontal  bones  \nand are themselves held between the frontal processes of \nthe maxillae (Figure 23.2).\nCartilaginous Part\nIt consists of:\n1. Upper lateral cartilages. They extend from the under-\nsurface of the nasal bones above, to the alar cartilages \nbelow. They fuse with each other and with the upper \nborder of the septal cartilage in the midline anteriorly. \nThe  lower  free  edge  of  upper  lateral  cartilage  is  seen  \nintranasally as limen vestibule, nasal valve or limen nasi \non each side.\n2. Lower  lateral  cartilages  (alar  cartilages).  Each  alar  \ncartilage is U-shaped. It has a lateral crus which forms \nthe ala and a medial crus which runs in the columella. \nLateral crus overlaps lower edge of upper lateral carti-\nlage on each side.\n3. Lesser alar (or sesamoid) cartilages. Two or more in \nnumber.  They  lie  above  and  lateral  to  alar  cartilages.  \nThe  various  cartilages  are  connected  with  one  anoth-\ner  and  with  the  adjoining  bones  by  perichondrium  \nand  periosteum.  Most  of  the  free  margin  of  nostril  is  \nformed of fibrofatty tissue and not the alar cartilage.\n4. Septal  cartilage.  Its  anterosuperior  border  runs  from  \nunder the nasal bones to the nasal tip. It supports the \ndorsum of the cartilaginous part of the nose. In septal \nabscess or after excessive removal of septal cartilage as \nin  submucosal  resection  (SMR)  operation,  support  of  \nnasal dorsum is lost and a supratip depression results.\nNASAL MUSCULATURE\nOsteocartilaginous framework of nose is covered by mus-\ncles  which  bring  about  movements  of  the  nasal  tip,  ala  \nand  the  overlying  skin.  They  are  the  procerus,  nasalis  \n(transverse and alar parts), levator labii superioris alaeque \nnasi,  anterior  and  posterior  dilator  nares  and  depressor  \nsepti.\nNASAL SKIN\nThe skin over the nasal bones and upper lateral cartilages \nis thin and freely mobile while that covering the alar carti-\nlages is thick and adherent, and contains many sebaceous \nglands.  It  is  the  hypertrophy  of  these  sebaceous  glands  \nwhich gives rise to a lobulated tumour called rhinophyma \n(see p. 162).\nINTERNAL NOSE\nIt  is  divided  into  right  and  left  nasal  cavities  by  nasal  \nseptum.  Each  nasal  cavity  communicates  with  the  exte-\nrior  through  naris  or  nostril  and  with  the  nasopharynx  \nthrough posterior nasal aperture or the choana. Each nasal \ncavity consists of a skin-lined portion—the vestibule and \na mucosa-lined portion, the nasal cavity proper.\nVESTIBULE OF NOSE\nAnterior  and  inferior  part  of  nasal  cavity  is  called  vesti-\nbule.  It  is  lined  by  skin  and  contains  sebaceous  glands,  \nhair follicles and the hair called vibrissae. Its upper limit \non  the  lateral  wall  is  marked  by  limen  nasi  (also  called  \nnasal valve).\n1. Nasal valve. It is bounded laterally by the lower bor-\nder of upper lateral cartilage and fibrofatty tissue and \nanterior  end  of  inferior  turbinate,  medially  by  the  \ncartilaginous nasal septum, and caudally by the floor \nof  pyriform  aperture.  The  angle  between  the  nasal  \nseptum  and  lower  border  of  upper  lateral  cartilage  is  \nnearly 30°.\n2. Nasal valve area. It is the cross-sectional area bounded \nby the structures forming the valve. It is the least cross-\nsectional area of nose and regulates airflow and resist-\nance on inspiration.\nNASAL CAVITY PROPER\nEach nasal cavity has a lateral wall, a medial wall, a roof \nand a floor.\nLateral Nasal Wall\nThree   and   occasionally   four   turbinates   or   conchae   \nmark the lateral wall of nose.

Some-\ntimes,  it  is  an  extension  of  infection  from  the  nasal  \nvestibule.  Treatment  is  systemic  antibacterials,  hot  fo-\nmentation and analgesics.\nNASAL DEFORMITIES\nSaddle Nose\nDepressed nasal dorsum may involve bony, cartilaginous \nor both bony and cartilaginous components of nasal dor-\nsum  (Figure  25.1).  Nasal  trauma  causing  depressed  frac-\ntures  is  the  most  common  aetiology.  It  can  also  result  \nfrom  excessive  removal  of  septum  in  submucous  resec-\ntion, destruction of septal cartilage by haematoma or ab-\nscess, sometimes by leprosy, tuberculosis or syphilis. The \ndeformity can be corrected by augmentation rhinoplasty \nby  filling  the  dorsum  with  cartilage,  bone  or  a  synthetic  \nimplant.  If  depression  is  only  cartilaginous,  cartilage  is  \ntaken from the nasal septum or auricle and laid in a single \nor multiple layers. If deformity involves both cartilage and \nbone, cancellous bone from the iliac crest is the best. Au-\ntografts (taken from the same individual) are preferred to \nallografts (taken from other individuals or cadavers). Sad-\ndle deformity can also be corrected by synthetic implants \nof silicone or teflon but they are likely to be extruded.\nHump Nose\nThis may also involve the bone or cartilage or both bone \nand cartilage. It can be corrected by reduction rhinoplasty \nwhich consists of exposure of nasal framework by careful \nraising of the nasal skin by a vestibular incision, removal \nof  hump  and  narrowing  of  the  lateral  walls  by  osteoto-\nmies to reduce the widening left by hump removal.\nCrooked or a Deviated Nose\nIn crooked nose, the midline of dorsum from frontonasal \nangle to the tip is curved in a C- or S-shaped manner. In a \ndeviated nose, the midline is straight but deviated to one \nside (Figure 25.2).\nUsually, these deformities are traumatic in origin. Inju-\nries sustained during birth, neonatal period or childhood, \nbut  not  immediately  recognized,  will  also  develop  into  \nthese deformities with the growth of nose. The deviated \nor  crooked  nose  can  be  corrected  by  rhinoplasty  or  sep-\ntorhinoplasty.  Aim  of  these  operations  is  to  correct  not  \nonly the outer appearance of nose but also its function.\nTUMOURS\nThey may be congenital, benign or malignant (Table 25.1).\n1. Congenital Tumours\n(a) dermoid cyst (Figure 25.3). It is of two types:\n•\tSimple  dermoid.  It  occurs  as  a  midline  swelling  under  \nthe  skin  but  in  front  of  the  nasal  bones.  It  does  not  \nhave any external opening.\n•\tDermoid with a sinus. It is seen in infants and children \nand  is  represented  by  a  pit  or  a  sinus  in  the  midline  \nof  the  dorsum  of  nose.  Hair  may  be  seen  protruding  \nthrough  the  sinus  opening.  In  these  cases,  the  sinus  \ntrack may lead to a dermoid cyst lying under the nasal \nbone  in  front  of  upper  part  of  nasal  septum  or  may  \nhave  an  intracranial  dural  connection.  In  those  with  \nintracranial  extension,  sinus  tract  passes  through  the  \ncribriform plate or foramen caecum and is attached to \ndura or has other intracranial connection. Meningitis \noccurs if infection travels along this path. Treatment of \nsuch cysts may necessitate splitting of the nasal bones \nto remove any extension in the upper part of the nasal \nseptum.  A  combined  neurosurgical–otolaryngologic  \napproach is required in those extending intracranially \nso as to close simultaneously any bony defect through \nwhich the fistulous tract passed (Figure 25.4).\n(b)  encephalocele or  meningoencephalocele.  It  is  \nherniation of brain tissue along with its meninges through \na congenital bony defect. An extranasal meningoenceph-\nalocele  presents  as  a  subcutaneous  pulsatile  swelling  in  \nthe midline at the root of nose (nasofrontal variety), side of \nnose (nasoethmoid variety) or on the anteromedial aspect \nof the orbit (naso-orbital variety).\nSwellings show cough impulse and may be reducible. \nTreatment  is  neurosurgical;  severing  the  tumour  stalk  \nfrom  the  brain  and  repairing  the  bony  defect  through  \nwhich herniation has taken place.\n(c)  glioma.  It  is  a  nipped  off  portion  of  encephalocele  \nduring embryonic development. Most of them (60%) are \nextranasal and present as firm subcutaneous swellings on \nthe bridge, side of nose or near the inner canthus. Some \nmebooksfree.com",

In a \ndeviated nose, the midline is straight but deviated to one \nside (Figure 25.2).\nUsually, these deformities are traumatic in origin.

It  \nconsists  of  elevating  the  mucoperichondrial  and  muco-\nperiosteal flaps on either side of the septal framework by a \nsingle incision made on one side of the septum, removing \nthe deflected parts of the bony and cartilaginous septum, \nand then repositioning the flaps (see section on Operative \nSurgery for details).\nSeptoplasty\nIt is a conservative approach to septal surgery. In this op-\neration, much of the septal framework is retained. Only \nthe  most  deviated  parts  are  removed.  Rest  of  the  septal  \nframework is corrected and repositioned by plastic means. \nMucoperichondrial/periosteal flap is generally raised only \non one side of the septum, retaining the attachment and \nblood  supply  on  the  other.  Septoplasty  has  now  almost  \nreplaced SMR operation (see Chapter 88).\nSeptal  surgery  is  usually  done  after  the  age  of  17  so  \nas  not  to  interfere  with  the  growth  of  nasal  skeleton.  \nHowever,  if  a  child  has  severe  septal  deviation  causing  \nmarked  nasal  obstruction,  conservative  septal  surgery  \n( septoplasty) can be performed to provide a good airway.\nSEPTAL HAEMATOMA\nAETIOLOGY\nIt is collection of blood under the perichondrium or peri-\nosteum of the nasal septum (Figure 26.7). It often results \nfrom nasal trauma or septal surgery. In bleeding disorders, \nit may occur spontaneously.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nBilateral  nasal  obstruction  is  the  commonest  presenting  \nsymptom. This may be associated with frontal headache \nand a sense of pressure over the nasal bridge.\nExamination  reveals  smooth  rounded  swelling  of  the  \nseptum in both the nasal fossae. Palpation may show the \nmass to be soft and fluctuant.\nTREATMENT\nSmall haematomas can be aspirated with a wide bore ster-\nile  needle.  Larger  haematomas  are  incised  and  drained  \nby a small anteroposterior incision parallel to the nasal \nfloor. Excision of a small piece of mucosa from the edge \nof  incision  gives  better  drainage.  Following  drainage,  \nnose is packed on both sides to prevent reaccumulation. \nSystemic  antibiotics  should  be  given  to  prevent  septal  \nabscess.\nCOMPLICATIONS\nSeptal  haematoma,  if  not  drained,  may  organize  into  fi-\nbrous tissue leading to a permanently thickened septum. \nIf secondary infection supervenes, it results in septal ab-\nscess  with  necrosis  of  cartilage  and  depression  of  nasal  \ndorsum.\nSEPTAL ABSCESS\nAETIOLOGY\nMostly, it results from secondary infection of septal hae-\nmatoma. Occasionally, it follows furuncle of the nose or \nupper  lip.  It  may  also  follow  acute  infection  such  as  ty-\nphoid or measles.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nThere is severe bilateral nasal obstruction with pain and \ntenderness over the bridge of nose. Patient may also com-\nplain of fever with chills and frontal headache. Skin over \nthe nose may be red and swollen.

Endocrinal or metabolic factors, e.g. hypothyroidism, \nexcessive intake of carbohydrates and lack of exercise.\nPathology\nSimple  chronic  rhinitis  is  an  early  stage  of  hypertroph-\nic  rhinitis.  There  is  hyperaemia  and  oedema  of  mucous  \nmembrane  with  hypertrophy  of  seromucinous  glands  \nand increase in goblet cells. Blood sinusoids particularly \nthose over the turbinates are distended.\nClinical Features\n1. Nasal obstruction. Usually worse on lying and affects \nthe dependent side of nose.\n2. Nasal discharge. It may be mucoid or mucopurulent, \nthick  and  viscid  and  often  trickles  into  the  throat  as  \npostnasal  drip.  Patient  has  a  constant  desire  to  blow  \nthe nose or clear the throat.\n3. Headache.  It  is  due  to  swollen  turbinates  impinging  \non the nasal septum.\n4. Swollen  turbinates.  Nasal  mucosa  is  dull  red  in  col-\nour.  Turbinates  are  swollen;  they  pit  on  pressure  and  \nshrink with application of vasoconstrictor drops (this \ndifferentiates  the  condition  from  hypertrophic  rhini-\ntis). Middle turbinate may also be swollen and impinge \non the septum.\n5. Postnasal  discharge.  Mucoid  or  mucopurulent  dis-\ncharge is seen on the posterior pharyngeal wall.\nTreatment\n1.  Treat  the  cause  with  particular  attention  to  sinuses,  \ntonsils, adenoids, allergy, personal habits (smoking or \nalcohol  indulgence),  environment  or  work  situation  \n(smoky or dusty surroundings).\n2.  Nasal  irrigations  with  alkaline  solution  help  to  keep  \nthe  nose  free  from  viscid  secretions  and  also  remove  \nsuperficial infection.\n3.  Nasal  decongestants  help  to  relieve  nasal  obstruction  \nand  improve  sinus  ventilation.  Excessive  use  of  nasal  \ndrops  and  sprays  should  be  avoided  because  it  may  \nlead to rhinitis medicamentosa. A short course of sys-\ntemic  steroids  helps  to  wean  the  patients  already  ad-\ndicted to excessive use of decongestant drops or sprays.\n4. Antibiotics help to clear nasal infection and concomi-\ntant sinusitis.\nHYPERTROPHIC RHINITIS\nIt is characterized by thickening of mucosa, submucosa, \nseromucinous glands, periosteum and bone. Changes are \nmore marked on the turbinates.\nAetiology\nCommon  causes  are  recurrent  nasal  infections,  chronic  \nsinusitis, chronic irritation of nasal mucosa due to smok-\ning, industrial irritants, prolonged use of nasal drops and \nvasomotor and allergic rhinitis.\nSymptoms\nNasal  obstruction  is  the  predominant  symptom.  Nasal  \ndischarge is thick and sticky. Some complain of headache, \nheaviness of head or transient anosmia.\nSigns\nExamination  shows  hypertrophy  of  turbinates.  Turbinal  \nmucosa is thick and does not pit on pressure. It shows lit-\ntle shrinkage with vasoconstrictor drugs due to presence \nof underlying fibrosis.\nMaximum changes are seen in the inferior turbinate. It \nmay be hypertrophied in its entirety or only at the ante-\nrior end, posterior end or along the inferior border giving \nit a mulberry appearance.\nTreatment\nAttempt  should  be  made  to  discover  the  cause  and  re-\nmove it. Nasal obstruction can be relieved by reduction in \nsize of turbinates. The various methods are:\n1. Linear cauterization.\n2. Submucosal diathermy.\n3. Cryosurgery of turbinates.\n4.  Partial  or  total  turbinectomy.  Hypertrophied  inferior  \nturbinate can be partially removed at its anterior end, \ninferior  border  or  posterior  end.  Middle  turbinate,  if  \nhypertrophied, can also be removed partially or  totally. \nExcessive removal of turbinates should be avoided as it \nleads to persistent crusting.\n5. Submucous resection of turbinate bone. This removes \nbony obstruction but preserves turbinal mucosa for its \nfunction.\n6.  Lasers  have  also  been  used  to  reduce  the  size  of  \nturbinates.\nCompensatory Hypertrophic Rhinitis\nThis  is  seen  in  cases  of  marked  deviation  of  septum  to  \none side. The roomier side of the nose shows hypertrophy \nof inferior and middle turbinates. This is an attempt on \nthe part of nature to reduce the wide space to overcome \nthe  ill  effects  of  drying  and  crusting  that  always  attend  \nwider  nasal  space.  Hypertrophic  changes  in  these  cases  \nare not reversible with the correction of nasal septum and \noften require reduction of turbinates at the time of septal \nsurgery.\nATROPHIC RHINITIS (OZAENA)\nIt is a chronic inflammation of nose characterized by atro-\nphy of nasal mucosa and turbinate bones. The nasal cavi-\nties  are  roomy  and  full  of  foul-smelling  crusts.  Atrophic  \nrhinitis is of two types: primary and secondary.\nPrimary Atrophic Rhinitis\naetiology (remember mnemonic hernia). The ex-\nact cause is not known.

Complete cure of the disease is not yet pos-\nsible.  Treatment  aims  at  maintaining  nasal  hygiene  by  \n  removal  of  crusts  and  the  associated  putrefying  smell,  \nand to further check crust formation.\n(a) Nasal  irrigation  and  removal  of  crusts.  Warm  normal  \nsaline  or  an  alkaline  solution  made  by  dissolving  a  \nteaspoonful of powder containing soda bicarbonate 1 \npart, sodium biborate 1 part, sodium chloride 2 parts \nin 280 mL of water is used to irrigate the nasal cavi-\nties.  The  solution  is  run  through  one  nostril  and  \ncomes  out  from  the  other.  It  loosens  the  crusts  and  \nremoves  thick  tenacious  discharge.  Care  should  be  \ntaken to avoid pushing the fluid into the sinuses and \neustachian tube. Initially, irrigations are done two or \nthree times a day but later once in every 2 or 3 days is \nsufficient. Hard crusts may be difficult to remove by \nirrigation. They are first loosened and then mechani-\ncally removed with forceps or suction.\n(b) 25% glucose in glycerine. After crusts are removed, nose \nis painted with 25% glucose in glycerine. This inhib-\nits the growth of proteolytic organisms which are re-\nsponsible for foul smell.\n(c) Local  antibiotics.  Spraying  or  painting  the  nose  with  \nappropriate  antibiotics  help  to  eliminate  secondary  \ninfection. Kemicetine™ antiozaena solution contains \nchloromycetin, oestradiol and vitamin D\n2\n and may be \nfound useful.\n(d) Oestradiol spray. Helps to increase vascularity of nasal \nmucosa and regeneration of seromucinous glands.\n(e) Placental  extract  injected  submucosally  in  the  nose  \nmay provide some relief.\n(f) Systemic  use  of  streptomycin.  1  g/day  for  10  days  has  \ngiven good results in reducing crusting and odour. It \nis effective against Klebsiella organisms.\n(g) Potassium  iodide  given  by  the  mouth  promotes  and  \nliquefies nasal secretion.\n2. surgical. It includes:\n(a) Young’s  operation.  Both  the  nostrils  are  closed  com-\npletely just within the nasal vestibule by raising flaps. \nThey  are  opened  after  6  months  or  later.  In  these  \ncases, mucosa may revert to normal and crusting re-\nduced.\nModified Young’s operation. To avoid the discomfort \nof  bilateral  nasal  obstruction,  modified  Young’s  op-\neration  aims  to  partially  close  the  nostrils.  It  is  also  \nclaimed to give the same benefit as Young’s.\n(b) Narrowing the nasal cavities. Nasal chambers are very \nwide  in  atrophic  rhinitis  and  air  currents  dry  up  se-\ncretions leading to crusting. Narrowing the size of the \nnasal  airway  helps  to  relieve  the  symptoms.  Among  \nthe techniques followed, some are:\n (i) Submucosal injection of teflon paste.\n  (ii)      Insertion  of  fat,  cartilage,  bone  or  teflon  strips  \nunder the mucoperiosteum of the floor and lat-\neral  wall  of  nose  and  the  mucoperichondrium  \nof the septum.\n (iii)    Section and medial displacement of lateral wall \nof nose.\nSecondary Atrophic Rhinitis\nSpecific infections like syphilis, lupus, leprosy and rhino-\nscleroma  may  cause  destruction  of  the  nasal  structures  \nleading  to  atrophic  changes.

Many  of  these  \nlesions may be manifestations of systemic diseases, which \nshould always be looked for while making the diagnosis. \nBiopsy of the lesion is also essential, not only to establish \nthe correct diagnosis of granulomatous disease but also to \nexclude a neoplasm, in which many of these diseases may \nclinically simulate.\nBACTERIAL INFECTIONS\nRHINOSCLEROMA\nIt  is  a  chronic  granulomatous  disease  caused  by  Gram-\nnegative bacillus called Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis or Frisch \nbacillus.  The  disease  is  endemic  in  several  parts  of  the  \nworld. In India, it is seen more often in the northern than \nin the southern parts.\nPathology\nThe  disease  starts  in  the  nose  and  extends  to  nasophar-\nynx,  oropharynx,  larynx  (mostly  subglottic  region),  tra-\nchea  and  bronchi.  Mode  of  infection  is  unknown.  Both  \nsexes of any age may be affected.\nClinical Features\nThe disease runs through the following stages:\n(a) Atrophic  stage.  It  resembles  atrophic  rhinitis  and  is  \ncharacterized   by   foul-smelling   purulent   nasal   dis-\ncharge and crusting.\n(b) Granulomatous stage. Granulomatous nodules form in \nnasal mucosa. There is also subdermal infiltration of low-\ner part of external nose and upper lip giving a “woody” \nfeel (Figure 28.1). Nodules are painless and nonulcerative.\n(c) Cicatricial stage. This causes stenosis of nares, distor-\ntion of upper lip, adhesions in the nose, nasopharynx \nand oropharynx. There may be subglottic stenosis with \nrespiratory distress.\nDiagnosis\nBiopsy shows infiltration of submucosa with plasma cells, \nlymphocytes, eosinophils, Mikulicz cells and Russell bod-\nies.  The  latter  two  are  diagnostic  features  of  the  disease  \n(Figure 28.2 ). Mikulicz cells are large foam cells with \na  central  nucleus  and  vacuolated  cytoplasm  containing  \ncausative bacilli. Russell bodies are homogenous eosino-\nphilic  inclusion  bodies  found  in  the  plasma  cells.  They  \noccur due to accumulation of immunoglobulins secreted \nby the plasma cells.

Treatment  is  \nstopped only when two consecutive cultures from the bi-\nopsy material are negative. Steroids can be combined to \nreduce fibrosis.\nSurgical treatment may be required to establish the air-\nway and correct nasal deformity.\nSYPHILIS\nNasal syphilis is of two types: acquired and congenital.\n1. acquired. It occurs as:\n(a) Primary. It manifests as primary chancre of the vesti-\nbule of nose. It is rare.\n(b) Secondary.  Rarely  recognized.  It  manifests  as  simple  \nrhinitis  with  crusting  and  fissuring  in  the  nasal  ves-\ntibule. Diagnosis is suggested by the presence of mu-\ncous patches in the pharynx, skin rash, fever and gen-\neralized lymphadenitis.\n(c) Tertiary. This is the stage in which nose is commonly \ninvolved.  Typical  manifestation  is  the  formation  of  \na  gumma  on  the  nasal  septum.  Later,  the  septum  is  \ndestroyed  both  in  its  bony  and  cartilaginous  parts.  \nPerforation may also appear in the hard palate. There \nis offensive nasal discharge with crusts.

It is seen in the first 3 months of life and \nmanifests as “snuffles.” Soon the nasal discharge be-\ncomes purulent. This is associated with fissuring and \nexcoriation of the nasal vestibule and of the upper lip.\n(b) Late  form.  Usually  manifests  around  puberty.  Clinical  \npicture is similar to that seen in tertiary stage of acquired \nsyphilis.  Gummatous  lesions  destroy  the  nasal  struc-\ntures.

Initially, there is exces-\nsive nasal discharge with red and swollen mucosa. Later, \ncrusting and bleeding supervene. Nodular lesions on the \nseptum may ulcerate and cause perforation. Late sequelae \nof  disease  are  atrophic  rhinitis,  depression  of  bridge  of  \nnose  and  destruction  of  anterior  nasal  spine  with  retru-\nsion of the columella (Figure 28.3).\nDiagnosis can be made from the scrapings of nasal mu-\ncosa and biopsy.

Histologically polymorphic \nlymphoid tissue with angiocentric and angioinvasive fea-\ntures is seen. There is no vasculitis—a feature typical of We-\ngener’s granulomatosis. Unlike Wegener’s granulomatosis, \nit is rapidly destructive and usually devoid of systemic in-\nvolvement;  there  is  absence  of  involvement  of  lung  and  \nkidneys. Immunohistochemical studies of biopsy material \nare  necessary  to  establish  diagnosis  of  T-cell  lymphoma.  \nLocalized T-cell lymphoma is treated by radiation while a \ndisseminated disease requires chemotherapy.\nSARCOIDOSIS\nIt is a granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology resem-\nbling tuberculosis on histology but with the absence of ca-\nseation.

A  feeding  nipple  \nwith  a  large  hole  provides  a  good  oral  airway  (McGov-\nern’s technique) and obviates the need for tracheostomy. \nDefinitive  treatment  consists  of  correction  of  atresia  by  \ntransnasal or transpalatal approach. The latter is usually \ndone at one and a half years. Choanal atresia can be cor-\nrected  by  using  nasal  endoscopes  and  drill.  Removal  of  \na  part  of  posterior  nasal  septum  transnasally  is  another  \noption to treat such cases.\nCSF RHINORRHOEA\nDEFINITION\nLeakage of CSF into the nose is called CSF rhinorrhoea. It \nmay be clear fluid or mixed with blood as in acute head \ninjuries.\nPHYSIOLOGY\nCSF  forms  a  jacket  of  fluid  round  the  brain  and  spinal  \ncord acting as a buffer against sudden jerks. It is secreted \nby choroid plexuses in the lateral, third and fourth ven-\ntricles  and  is  absorbed  into  the  dural  venous  sinuses  by  \narachnoid  villi.  Villi  have  one-way  valve  mechanism  al-\nlowing CSF of the subarachnoid space to be absorbed into \nthe  blood  but  not  vice  versa.  Total  volume  of  CSF  var-\nies from 90 to 150 mL. It is secreted at the rate of about \n20  mL/h  (350-500  mL/day).  Thus  total  CSF  is  replaced  \nthree to five times every day. Normal CSF pressure at lum-\nbar  puncture  is  50-150  mm  H\n2\nO.  CSF  pressure  rises  on  \ncoughing, sneezing, nose blowing, straining on stools or \nlifting  heavy  weight–activities  which  should  be  avoided  \nin cases of CSF leak or after its repair.\nAETIOLOGY\n•\tTrauma. Most of the cases follow trauma. It can be acci-\ndental or surgical. Surgical trauma includes endoscopic \nsinus  surgery,  trans-sphenoidal  hypophysectomy,  na-\nsal  polypectomy  or  skull  base  surgery.  In  endoscopic  \nsinus  surgery,  CSF  leak  may  be  immediate  or  delayed  \nin onset.\n•\tInflammations. Mucoceles of sinuses, sinunasal polypo-\nsis, fungal infection of sinuses and osteomyelitis, can \nall erode the bone and dura.\n•\tNeoplasms.  Tumours,  both  benign  and  malignant,  in-\nvading the skull base.\n•\tCongenital lesions. Meningocele, meningoencephaloce-\nles and gliomas can have associated skull base defect.\n•\tIdiopathic.  Where  cause  is  unknown  and  patient  has  \nspontaneous leak.\nSITES OF LEAKAGE\nCSF from anterior cranial fossa reaches the nose via (i) cri-\nbriform  plate,  (ii)  roof  of  ethmoid  air  cells  or  (iii)  fron-\ntal sinus. CSF from middle cranial fossa follows injuries to \nsphenoid sinus. In fractures of temporal bone, CSF reaches \nthe middle ear and then escapes through the eustachian \ntube into the nose (CSF otorhinorrhoea) (Figure 29.4).\nFigure 29.3. Nasal synechia left.\nFigure  29.4.  Sites  of  leakage:  (a)  frontal  sinus,  (b)  ethmoid  sinus,  \n(c) sphenoid sinus, and (d) eustachian tube (temporal bone fracture).\nmebooksfree.com",

Removal  of  \na  part  of  posterior  nasal  septum  transnasally  is  another  \noption to treat such cases.\nCSF RHINORRHOEA\nDEFINITION\nLeakage of CSF into the nose is called CSF rhinorrhoea. It \nmay be clear fluid or mixed with blood as in acute head \ninjuries.\nPHYSIOLOGY\nCSF  forms  a  jacket  of  fluid  round  the  brain  and  spinal  \ncord acting as a buffer against sudden jerks. It is secreted \nby choroid plexuses in the lateral, third and fourth ven-\ntricles  and  is  absorbed  into  the  dural  venous  sinuses  by  \narachnoid  villi.  Villi  have  one-way  valve  mechanism  al-\nlowing CSF of the subarachnoid space to be absorbed into \nthe  blood  but  not  vice  versa.  Total  volume  of  CSF  var-\nies from 90 to 150 mL. It is secreted at the rate of about \n20  mL/h  (350-500  mL/day).  Thus  total  CSF  is  replaced",

Thus  total  CSF  is  replaced  \nthree to five times every day. Normal CSF pressure at lum-\nbar  puncture  is  50-150  mm  H\n2\nO.  CSF  pressure  rises  on  \ncoughing, sneezing, nose blowing, straining on stools or \nlifting  heavy  weight–activities  which  should  be  avoided  \nin cases of CSF leak or after its repair.\nAETIOLOGY\n•\tTrauma. Most of the cases follow trauma. It can be acci-\ndental or surgical. Surgical trauma includes endoscopic \nsinus  surgery,  trans-sphenoidal  hypophysectomy,  na-\nsal  polypectomy  or  skull  base  surgery.  In  endoscopic  \nsinus  surgery,  CSF  leak  may  be  immediate  or  delayed  \nin onset.\n•\tInflammations.

Where  cause  is  unknown  and  patient  has  \nspontaneous leak.\nSITES OF LEAKAGE\nCSF from anterior cranial fossa reaches the nose via (i) cri-\nbriform  plate,  (ii)  roof  of  ethmoid  air  cells  or  (iii)  fron-\ntal sinus. CSF from middle cranial fossa follows injuries to \nsphenoid sinus. In fractures of temporal bone, CSF reaches \nthe middle ear and then escapes through the eustachian \ntube into the nose (CSF otorhinorrhoea) (Figure 29.4).\nFigure 29.3.

      "content": "187\nChapter 30\nAllergic Rhinitis\nIt is an IgE-mediated immunologic response of nasal mu-\ncosa to airborne allergens and is characterized by watery \nnasal  discharge,  nasal  obstruction,  sneezing  and  itching  \nin the nose. This may also be associated with symptoms \nof  itching  in  the  eyes,  palate  and  pharynx.  Two  clinical  \ntypes have been recognized:\n1. Seasonal. Symptoms appear in or around a particular \nseason when the pollens of a particular plant, to which \nthe patient is sensitive, are present in the air.\n2. Perennial. Symptoms are present throughout the year.\nAETIOLOGY\ninhalant  allergens.  They  may  be  seasonal  or  peren-\nnial. Seasonal allergens include pollens from trees, grasses \nand  weeds.  They  vary  geographically.  The  knowledge  \nof  pollen  appearing  in  a  particular  area  and  the  sea-\nson  in  which  they  occur  is  important.  Their  knowledge  \nalso  helps  in  skin  tests.  Perennial  allergens  are  present  \nthroughout  the  year  regardless  of  the  season.  They  in-\nclude  molds,  dust  mites,  cockroaches  and  dander  from  \nanimals. Dust includes dust mite, insect parts, fibres and \nanimal danders. Dust mites live on skin scales and other \ndebris and are found in the beddings, mattresses, pillows, \ncarpets and upholstery.\ngenetic predisposition. plays an important part. Chanc-\nes  of  children  developing  allergy  are  20  and  47%,  respec-\ntively, if one or both parents suffer from allergic diathesis.\nPATHOGENESIS\nInhaled allergens produce specific IgE antibody in the ge-\nnetically predisposed individuals. This antibody becomes \nfixed to the blood basophils or tissue mast cells by its Fc \nend  (Figure  30.1 ).  On  subsequent  exposure,  antigen  \ncombines with IgE antibody at its Fab end. This reaction \nproduces  degranulation  of  the  mast  cells  with  release  of  \nseveral chemical mediators, some of which already exist \nin the preformed state while others are synthesized afresh. \nThese  mediators  (Figure  30.2)  are  responsible  for  symp-\ntomatology of allergic disease. Depending on the tissues \ninvolved, there may be vasodilation, mucosal oedema, in-\nfiltration with eosinophils, excessive secretion from nasal \nglands or smooth muscle contraction. A “priming affect” \nhas  also  been  described,  i.e.  mucosa  earlier  sensitized  to  \nan allergen will react to smaller doses of subsequent spe-\ncific  allergen.  It  also  gets  “primed”  to  other  nonspecific  \nantigens to which patient was not exposed (Figure 30.3). \nNonspecific  nasal  hyper-reactivity  is  seen  in  patients  of  \nallergic rhinitis. There is increased nasal response to nor-\nmal stimuli resulting in sneezing, rhinorrhoea and nasal \ncongestion.  Clinically,  allergic  response  occurs  in  two  \nphases:\n1. Acute  or  early  phase.  It  occurs  immediately  within  \n5–30  min,  after  exposure  to  the  specific  allergen  and  \nconsists of sneezing, rhinorrhoea nasal blockage and/\nor  bronchospasm.  It  is  due  to  release  of  vasoactive  \namines like histamine.\n2. Late or delayed phase. It occurs 2–8 h after exposure \nto  allergen  without  additional  exposure.  It  is  due  to  \ninfiltration  of  inflammatory  cells—eosinophils,  neu-\ntrophils, basophil, monocytes and CD\n4\n + T cells at the \nsite of antigen deposition causing swelling, congestion \nand  thick  secretion.

        "187\nChapter 30\nAllergic Rhinitis\nIt is an IgE-mediated immunologic response of nasal mu-\ncosa to airborne allergens and is characterized by watery \nnasal  discharge,  nasal  obstruction,  sneezing  and  itching  \nin the nose. This may also be associated with symptoms \nof  itching  in  the  eyes,  palate  and  pharynx.  Two  clinical  \ntypes have been recognized:\n1. Seasonal. Symptoms appear in or around a particular \nseason when the pollens of a particular plant, to which \nthe patient is sensitive, are present in the air.\n2. Perennial. Symptoms are present throughout the year.\nAETIOLOGY\ninhalant  allergens.  They  may  be  seasonal  or  peren-\nnial. Seasonal allergens include pollens from trees, grasses \nand  weeds.

Perennial  allergens  are  present  \nthroughout  the  year  regardless  of  the  season.  They  in-\nclude  molds,  dust  mites,  cockroaches  and  dander  from  \nanimals. Dust includes dust mite, insect parts, fibres and \nanimal danders. Dust mites live on skin scales and other \ndebris and are found in the beddings, mattresses, pillows, \ncarpets and upholstery.\ngenetic predisposition. plays an important part. Chanc-\nes  of  children  developing  allergy  are  20  and  47%,  respec-\ntively, if one or both parents suffer from allergic diathesis.\nPATHOGENESIS\nInhaled allergens produce specific IgE antibody in the ge-\nnetically predisposed individuals.

On  subsequent  exposure,  antigen  \ncombines with IgE antibody at its Fab end. This reaction \nproduces  degranulation  of  the  mast  cells  with  release  of  \nseveral chemical mediators, some of which already exist \nin the preformed state while others are synthesized afresh. \nThese  mediators  (Figure  30.2)  are  responsible  for  symp-\ntomatology of allergic disease. Depending on the tissues \ninvolved, there may be vasodilation, mucosal oedema, in-\nfiltration with eosinophils, excessive secretion from nasal \nglands or smooth muscle contraction. A “priming affect” \nhas  also  been  described,  i.e.  mucosa  earlier  sensitized  to  \nan allergen will react to smaller doses of subsequent spe-\ncific  allergen.  It  also  gets  “primed”  to  other  nonspecific  \nantigens to which patient was not exposed (Figure 30.3).",

It  also  gets  “primed”  to  other  nonspecific  \nantigens to which patient was not exposed (Figure 30.3). \nNonspecific  nasal  hyper-reactivity  is  seen  in  patients  of  \nallergic rhinitis. There is increased nasal response to nor-\nmal stimuli resulting in sneezing, rhinorrhoea and nasal \ncongestion.  Clinically,  allergic  response  occurs  in  two  \nphases:\n1. Acute  or  early  phase.  It  occurs  immediately  within  \n5–30  min,  after  exposure  to  the  specific  allergen  and  \nconsists of sneezing, rhinorrhoea nasal blockage and/\nor  bronchospasm.  It  is  due  to  release  of  vasoactive  \namines like histamine.\n2. Late or delayed phase. It occurs 2–8 h after exposure \nto  allergen  without  additional  exposure.  It  is  due  to  \ninfiltration  of  inflammatory  cells—eosinophils,  neu-\ntrophils, basophil, monocytes and CD\n4\n + T cells at the",

Antrochoanal polyp.\n2. Bilateral ethmoidal polypi.\nANTROCHOANAL POLYP  \n(SYN. KILLIAN’S POLYP)\nThis  polyp  arises  from  the  mucosa  of  maxillary  antrum  \nnear  its  accessory  ostium,  comes  out  of  it  and  grows  in  \nthe choana and nasal cavity. Thus it has three parts.\n1. Antral, which is a thin stalk.\n2. Choanal, which is round and globular.\n3. Nasal, which is flat from side to side.\nAETIOLOGY\nExact cause is unknown. Nasal allergy coupled with sinus \ninfection  is  incriminated.  Antrochoanal  polypi  are  seen  \nin children and young adults. Usually they are single and \nunilateral.\nSYMPTOMS\nUnilateral  nasal  obstruction  is  the  presenting  symptom.  \nObstruction may become bilateral when polyp grows into \nthe nasopharynx and starts obstructing the opposite cho-\nana (Tables 32.1 and 32.2). Voice may become thick and \ndull due to hyponasality.

        "193\nChapter 32\nNasal Polypi\nNasal  polypi  are  non-neoplastic  masses  of  oedematous  \nnasal  or  sinus  mucosa.  They  are  divided  into  two  main  \nvarieties:\n1. Antrochoanal polyp.\n2. Bilateral ethmoidal polypi.\nANTROCHOANAL POLYP  \n(SYN. KILLIAN’S POLYP)\nThis  polyp  arises  from  the  mucosa  of  maxillary  antrum  \nnear  its  accessory  ostium,  comes  out  of  it  and  grows  in  \nthe choana and nasal cavity. Thus it has three parts.\n1. Antral, which is a thin stalk.\n2. Choanal, which is round and globular.\n3. Nasal, which is flat from side to side.\nAETIOLOGY\nExact cause is unknown. Nasal allergy coupled with sinus \ninfection  is  incriminated.  Antrochoanal  polypi  are  seen  \nin children and young adults. Usually they are single and \nunilateral.\nSYMPTOMS\nUnilateral  nasal  obstruction  is  the  presenting  symptom.  \nObstruction may become bilateral when polyp grows into \nthe nasopharynx and starts obstructing the opposite cho-",

Voice may become thick and \ndull due to hyponasality. Nasal discharge, mostly mucoid, \nmay be seen on one or both sides.\nSIGNS\nAs  the  antrochoanal  polyp  grows  posteriorly,  it  may  be  \nmissed  on  anterior  rhinoscopy.

Others  result  from  sports,  personal  accidents,  \nassaults and fights. The management of facial trauma can \nbe divided into:\n1. General management.\n2. Soft tissue injuries and their management.\n3. Bone injuries and their management.\nGENERAL MANAGEMENT\n1. Airway.  Maintenance  of  airway  should  receive  the  \nhighest priority. Airway is obstructed by loss of skeletal \nsupport, aspiration of foreign bodies, blood or gastric \ncontents  or  swelling  of  tissues.  Airway  is  secured  by  \nintubation or the tracheostomy.\n2. Haemorrhage.  Injuries  of  face  may  bleed  profusely.  \nBleeding should be stopped by pressure or ligation of \nvessels.\n3. Associated injuries. Facial injuries may be associated \nwith  injuries  of  head,  chest,  abdomen,  neck,  larynx,  \ncervical spine or limbs and should be attended too.\nSOFT TISSUE INJURIES AND THEIR \nMANAGEMENT\nFACIAL LACERATIONS\nWound  is  thoroughly  cleaned  of  any  dirt,  grease  or  for-\neign  matter.  The  lacerations  are  closed  by  accurate  ap-\nproximation of each layer.\nPAROTID GLAND AND DUCT\nParotid tissue, if exposed, is repaired by suturing. Injuries \nof parotid duct are more serious. Both ends of the duct are \nidentified and sutured over a polyethylene tube with fine \nsuture. The tube is left for 3 days to 2 weeks.\nFACIAL NERVE\nIf  severed,  the  facial  nerve  is  exposed  by  superficial  pa-\nrotidectomy and cut ends are approximated with 8–0 or \n10–0 silk under magnification.\nBONE INJURIES AND THEIR \nMANAGEMENT\nThe face can be divided into three regions:\n1. Upper third. Above the level of supraorbital ridge.\n2. Middle third. Between the supraorbital ridge and the \nupper teeth.\n3. Lower third. Mandible and the lower teeth.\nThe various fractures encountered in these regions are \nlisted in Table 34.1.\nI. FRACTURES OF UPPER THIRD OF FACE\nA. FRONTAL SINUS\nFrontal  sinus  fractures  may  involve  anterior  wall,  poste-\nrior wall or the nasofrontal duct.\n1. Anterior  wall  fractures  may  be  depressed  or  commi-\nnuted. Defect is mainly cosmetic. Sinus is approached \nthrough  a  wound  in  the  skin  if  that  is  present,  or  \nthrough  a  brow  incision.  The  bone  fragments  are  el-\nevated, taking care not to strip them from the perios-\nteum. The interior of the sinus is always inspected to \nrule out fracture of the posterior wall.\n2. Posterior  wall  fractures  may  be  accompanied  by  dural  \ntears,  brain  injury  and  CSF  rhinorrhoea.  They  may  \nrequire  neurosurgical  consultation.  Dural  tears  can  \nbe  covered  by  temporalis  fascia.  Small  sinuses  can  be  \nobliterated with fat.\n3. Injury  to  nasofrontal  duct  causes  obstruction  to  sinus  \ndrainage and may later be complicated by a mucocele. \nIn  such  cases,  make  a  large  communication  between  \nthe sinus and the nose. Small sinuses can be obliterated \nwith fat after removing the sinus mucosa completely.\nB. SUPRAORBITAL RIDGE\nRidge  fractures  often  cause  periorbital  ecchymosis,  flat-\ntening  of  the  eyebrow,  proptosis  or  downward  displace-\nment of eye. Fragment of bone may also be pushed into \nthe orbit and get impacted. Ridge fractures require open \nreduction through an incision in the brow or transverse \nskin line of the forehead.\nC. FRACTURES OF FRONTAL BONE\nThey may be depressed or linear, with or without separa-\ntion. They often extend into the orbit. Brain injury and \ncerebral oedema are commonly associated with each oth-\ner and require neurosurgical consultation.\nII. FRACTURES OF MIDDLE THIRD OF FACE\nA.

        "203\nChapter 34\nTrauma to the Face\nInjuries  of  face  may  involve  soft  tissues,  bones  or  both.  \nThe majority of facial injuries are caused by automobile \naccidents.  Others  result  from  sports,  personal  accidents,  \nassaults and fights. The management of facial trauma can \nbe divided into:\n1. General management.\n2. Soft tissue injuries and their management.\n3. Bone injuries and their management.\nGENERAL MANAGEMENT\n1. Airway.  Maintenance  of  airway  should  receive  the  \nhighest priority. Airway is obstructed by loss of skeletal \nsupport, aspiration of foreign bodies, blood or gastric \ncontents  or  swelling  of  tissues.  Airway  is  secured  by  \nintubation or the tracheostomy.\n2. Haemorrhage.  Injuries  of  face  may  bleed  profusely.  \nBleeding should be stopped by pressure or ligation of \nvessels.\n3. Associated injuries. Facial injuries may be associated \nwith  injuries  of  head,  chest,  abdomen,  neck,  larynx,  \ncervical spine or limbs and should be attended too.",
        "vessels.\n3. Associated injuries. Facial injuries may be associated \nwith  injuries  of  head,  chest,  abdomen,  neck,  larynx,  \ncervical spine or limbs and should be attended too.\nSOFT TISSUE INJURIES AND THEIR \nMANAGEMENT\nFACIAL LACERATIONS\nWound  is  thoroughly  cleaned  of  any  dirt,  grease  or  for-\neign  matter.  The  lacerations  are  closed  by  accurate  ap-\nproximation of each layer.\nPAROTID GLAND AND DUCT\nParotid tissue, if exposed, is repaired by suturing. Injuries \nof parotid duct are more serious. Both ends of the duct are \nidentified and sutured over a polyethylene tube with fine \nsuture. The tube is left for 3 days to 2 weeks.\nFACIAL NERVE\nIf  severed,  the  facial  nerve  is  exposed  by  superficial  pa-\nrotidectomy and cut ends are approximated with 8–0 or \n10–0 silk under magnification.\nBONE INJURIES AND THEIR \nMANAGEMENT\nThe face can be divided into three regions:\n1. Upper third. Above the level of supraorbital ridge.",
        "10–0 silk under magnification.\nBONE INJURIES AND THEIR \nMANAGEMENT\nThe face can be divided into three regions:\n1. Upper third. Above the level of supraorbital ridge.\n2. Middle third. Between the supraorbital ridge and the \nupper teeth.\n3. Lower third. Mandible and the lower teeth.\nThe various fractures encountered in these regions are \nlisted in Table 34.1.\nI. FRACTURES OF UPPER THIRD OF FACE\nA. FRONTAL SINUS\nFrontal  sinus  fractures  may  involve  anterior  wall,  poste-\nrior wall or the nasofrontal duct.\n1. Anterior  wall  fractures  may  be  depressed  or  commi-\nnuted. Defect is mainly cosmetic. Sinus is approached \nthrough  a  wound  in  the  skin  if  that  is  present,  or  \nthrough  a  brow  incision.  The  bone  fragments  are  el-\nevated, taking care not to strip them from the perios-\nteum. The interior of the sinus is always inspected to \nrule out fracture of the posterior wall.\n2. Posterior  wall  fractures  may  be  accompanied  by  dural",
        "teum. The interior of the sinus is always inspected to \nrule out fracture of the posterior wall.\n2. Posterior  wall  fractures  may  be  accompanied  by  dural  \ntears,  brain  injury  and  CSF  rhinorrhoea.  They  may  \nrequire  neurosurgical  consultation.  Dural  tears  can  \nbe  covered  by  temporalis  fascia.  Small  sinuses  can  be  \nobliterated with fat.\n3. Injury  to  nasofrontal  duct  causes  obstruction  to  sinus  \ndrainage and may later be complicated by a mucocele. \nIn  such  cases,  make  a  large  communication  between  \nthe sinus and the nose. Small sinuses can be obliterated \nwith fat after removing the sinus mucosa completely.\nB. SUPRAORBITAL RIDGE\nRidge  fractures  often  cause  periorbital  ecchymosis,  flat-\ntening  of  the  eyebrow,  proptosis  or  downward  displace-\nment of eye. Fragment of bone may also be pushed into \nthe orbit and get impacted. Ridge fractures require open \nreduction through an incision in the brow or transverse",

Brain injury and \ncerebral oedema are commonly associated with each oth-\ner and require neurosurgical consultation.\nII. FRACTURES OF MIDDLE THIRD OF FACE\nA.

Periorbital emphysema, due to escape of air from the \nmaxillary sinus on nose blowing.\nDiagnosis\nWaters’  or  exaggerated  Waters’  view  shows  the  fracture  \nand  displacement  the  best.  Maxillary  sinus  may  show  \nclouding  due  to  the  presence  of  blood.  Comminution  \nwith depression of orbital floor and herniation of orbital \ncontents cannot be seen on plain X-rays.

Fracture \nis exposed at the frontozygomatic suture through lateral \nbrow incision and reduced by passing an elevator behind \nthe zygoma. Wire fixation is done at frontozygomatic su-\nture  and  infraorbital  margin.  The  latter  is  exposed  by  a  \nseparate incision in the lower lid. Fracture of orbital floor \ncan also be repaired through this incision.\nTransantral approach is less favourable.

      "content": "Chapter 35 — Anatomy and Physiology of Paranasal Sinuses\n211\nMUCOUS MEMBRANE OF PARANASAL \nSINUSES\nParanasal sinuses are lined by mucous membrane which \nis  continuous  with  that  of  the  nasal  cavity  through  the  \nostia of sinuses. It is thinner and less vascular compared \nto that of the nasal cavity. Histologically, it is ciliated co-\nlumnar epithelium with goblet cells which secrete mucus. \nCilia are more marked near the ostia of sinuses and help \nin drainage of mucus into the nasal cavity.\nDEVELOPMENT OF PARANASAL SINUSES\nParanasal sinuses develop as outpouchings from the mu-\ncous membrane of lateral wall of nose. At birth, only the \nmaxillary and ethmoidal sinuses are present and are large \nenough to be clinically significant.\nGrowth  of  sinuses  continues  during  childhood  and  \nearly  adult  life.  Radiologically,  maxillary  sinuses  can  be  \nidentified at 4–5 months, ethmoids at 1 year, frontals at \n6 years and sphenoids at 4 years (Table 35.1).\nLYMPHATIC DRAINAGE\nThe lymphatics of maxillary, ethmoid, frontal and sphe-\nnoid sinuses form a capillary network in their lining mu-\ncosa  and  collect  with  lymphatics  of  nasal  cavity.  Then  \nthey  drain  into  lateral  retropharyngeal  and/or  jugulodi-\ngastric nodes.\nPHYSIOLOGY OF PARANASAL SINUSES\nVENTILATION OF SINUSES\nVentilation of paranasal sinuses takes place through their \nostia. During inspiration, air current causes negative pres-\nsure  in  the  nose.  This  varies  from  −6  mm  to  −200  mm  \nH\n2\nO,  depending  on  the  force  of  inspiration.  During  ex-\npiration, positive pressure is created in the nose and this \nsets up eddies which ventilate the sinuses.

        "Chapter 35 — Anatomy and Physiology of Paranasal Sinuses\n211\nMUCOUS MEMBRANE OF PARANASAL \nSINUSES\nParanasal sinuses are lined by mucous membrane which \nis  continuous  with  that  of  the  nasal  cavity  through  the  \nostia of sinuses. It is thinner and less vascular compared \nto that of the nasal cavity. Histologically, it is ciliated co-\nlumnar epithelium with goblet cells which secrete mucus. \nCilia are more marked near the ostia of sinuses and help \nin drainage of mucus into the nasal cavity.\nDEVELOPMENT OF PARANASAL SINUSES\nParanasal sinuses develop as outpouchings from the mu-\ncous membrane of lateral wall of nose. At birth, only the \nmaxillary and ethmoidal sinuses are present and are large \nenough to be clinically significant.\nGrowth  of  sinuses  continues  during  childhood  and  \nearly  adult  life.  Radiologically,  maxillary  sinuses  can  be  \nidentified at 4–5 months, ethmoids at 1 year, frontals at \n6 years and sphenoids at 4 years (Table 35.1).\nLYMPHATIC DRAINAGE",

Radiologically,  maxillary  sinuses  can  be  \nidentified at 4–5 months, ethmoids at 1 year, frontals at \n6 years and sphenoids at 4 years (Table 35.1).\nLYMPHATIC DRAINAGE\nThe lymphatics of maxillary, ethmoid, frontal and sphe-\nnoid sinuses form a capillary network in their lining mu-\ncosa  and  collect  with  lymphatics  of  nasal  cavity.  Then  \nthey  drain  into  lateral  retropharyngeal  and/or  jugulodi-\ngastric nodes.\nPHYSIOLOGY OF PARANASAL SINUSES\nVENTILATION OF SINUSES\nVentilation of paranasal sinuses takes place through their \nostia. During inspiration, air current causes negative pres-\nsure  in  the  nose.  This  varies  from  −6  mm  to  −200  mm  \nH\n2\nO,  depending  on  the  force  of  inspiration.  During  ex-\npiration, positive pressure is created in the nose and this \nsets up eddies which ventilate the sinuses.

Most  commonly,  it  is  viral  rhinitis  which  spreads  to  \ninvolve the sinus mucosa. This is followed by bacterial \ninvasion.\n2. Diving and swimming in contaminated water.\n3.  Dental  infections  are  important  source  of  maxillary  \nsinusitis.  Roots  of  premolar  and  molar  teeth  are  re-\nlated to the floor of sinus and may be separated only \nby a thin layer of mucosal covering. Periapical den-\ntal  abscess  may  burst  into  the  sinus;  or  the  root  of  \na  tooth,  during  extraction,  may  be  pushed  into  the  \nsinus. In case of oroantral fistula, following tooth ex-\ntraction, bacteria from oral cavity enter the maxillary \nsinus.\n4. Trauma to the sinus such as compound fractures, pen-\netrating injuries or gunshot wounds may be followed \nby sinusitis.\nPredisposing factors\nOne or more of the predisposing factors enumerated for \nsinusitis in general may be responsible for acute or recur-\nrent infection.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nClinical  features  depend  on  (i)  severity  of  inflammatory  \nprocess and (ii) efficiency of ostium to drain the exudates. \nClosed  ostium  sinusitis  is  of  greater  severity  and  leads  \nmore often to complications.\n1. Constitutional  symptoms.  It  consist  of  fever,  general  \nmalaise and body ache. They are the result of toxaemia.\n2. Headache.  Usually,  this  is  confined  to  forehead  and  \nmay thus be confused with frontal sinusitis.\n3. Pain.

Dental  infections  are  important  source  of  maxillary  \nsinusitis.  Roots  of  premolar  and  molar  teeth  are  re-\nlated to the floor of sinus and may be separated only \nby a thin layer of mucosal covering. Periapical den-\ntal  abscess  may  burst  into  the  sinus;  or  the  root  of  \na  tooth,  during  extraction,  may  be  pushed  into  the  \nsinus. In case of oroantral fistula, following tooth ex-\ntraction, bacteria from oral cavity enter the maxillary \nsinus.\n4.

They  \nhave been used preoperatively to reduce size of polyps \nand postoperatively to prevent recurrence.\n2. Steroid nasal sprays. They decrease polyp size and oede-\nma of nasal mucosa.\n3. Nasal irrigations. They are helpful in removing patho-\ngens, allergen load and thick mucus.\n4. Antibiotics. They can be used in cases of acute exacerba-\ntions of CRS with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophi-\nlus influenzae and Moraxella. Antibiotics remove bacte-\nria and down-regulate inflammatory mediators.\n5. Management  of  allergy.  In  patients  with  history  of  \nknown allergies, immunotherapy may be prescribed.\n6. Treatment of asthma. Asthma is a co-morbid condition \nin case of CRS and should be treated with help from a \nrespiratory physician.\nMedical  treatment  often  fails  in  massive  nasal  poly-\nposis and requires endoscopic surgery. All polyps are re-\nmoved, and drainage and ventilation provided to all in-\nvolved sinuses.\nMany  cases  require  revision  surgery  for  recurrence  of  \npolypi.\nCases  of  cystic  fibrosis  and  ciliary  dyskinesia  require  \nspecific  modifications  of  endoscopic  surgery  to  provide  \ndependent  drainage  in  maxillary  and  sphenoid  sinuses  \ninfections, as ciliary function is nonexistent and the mu-\ncus is too thick to allow drainage.\nOlder surgical techniques used to treat chronic sinus-\nitis  of  individual  sinuses  are  described  in  the  following  \nsection.  Present  day  treatment  of  choice  for  CRS  with  \nor  without  polypi  is  endoscopic  sinus  surgery  popularly  \ncalled FESS (functional endoscopic sinus surgery).\nOLDER SURGICAL TECHNIQUES FOR \nCHRONIC SINUSITIS\nCHRONIC MAXILLARY SINUSITIS\n1. Antral puncture and irrigation. Sinus cavity is irrigat-\ned with a cannula passed through the inferior meatus. \nRemoval of pus and exudates helps the sinus mucosa \nto revert to normal.\n2. Intranasal  antrostomy.  It  is  indicated  if  sinus  irriga-\ntions fail to resolve infection. A window is created in \nthe  inferior  meatus  to  provide  aeration  to  the  sinus  \nand its free drainage.\n3. Caldwell–Luc  operation.  In  this  operation,  antrum  \nis  entered  through  its  anterior  wall  by  a  sublabial  in-\ncision.  All  irreversible  diseases  are  removed  and  a  \nwindow  is  created  between  the  antrum  and  inferior  \nmeatus.\nDetails of the above operations are described in the sec-\ntion on Operative Surgery.\nCHRONIC FRONTAL SINUSITIS\n1. Intranasal  drainage  operations.  Correction  of  devi-\nated  septum,  removal  of  a  polyp  or  anterior  portion  \nof middle turbinate, or intranasal ethmoidectomy pro-\nvide drainage through the frontonasal duct. Treatment \nof  associated  maxillary  sinusitis  also  helps  to  resolve  \nchronic frontal sinusitis.\n2. Trephination of frontal sinus (see p. 215).\n3. External    frontoethmoidectomy    (Howarth’s    or    \nLynch   operation).   The   frontal   sinus   is   entered   \nthrough  its  floor  by  a  curvilinear  incision  round  the  \ninner  margin  of  the  orbit.  Diseased  mucosa  is  re-\nmoved, ethmoid cells exenterated and a new fronto-\nnasal duct created.\n4. Osteoplastic  flap  operation.  It  may  be  unilateral  or  \nbilateral. A coronal or a brow incision is used. The an-\nterior wall of frontal sinus is reflected as an osteoplastic \nflap, based inferiorly. The diseased tissues are removed \nand the sinus drained through a new frontonasal duct. \nIf  it  is  desired  to  obliterate  the  sinus,  all  diseased  as  \nwell as healthy mucosa are stripped off and the sinus \nobliterated with fat.\nCHRONIC ETHMOID SINUSITIS\n1. Intranasal  ethmoidectomy.  This  operation  is  done  \nfor  chronic  ethmoiditis  with  polyp  formation.  The  \nethmoid air cells and the diseased tissue are removed \nbetween the middle turbinate and the medial wall of \norbit by the intranasal route. The frontal and sphenoid \nsinuses can also be drained by this operation.\n2. External ethmoidectomy. In this operation, ethmoid \nsinuses  are  approached  through  medial  orbital  in-\ncision.  Access  can  also  be  obtained  to  sphenoid  and  \nfrontal  sinuses  and  the  operation  is  called  fronto-\nspheno-ethmoidectomy.\nmebooksfree.com",

Complications are said to arise when \ninfection  spreads  into  or  beyond  the  bony  wall  of  the  \nsinus (see Table 38.1 and Figure 38.1).\nI. LOCAL COMPLICATIONS\nA. MUCOCELE OF PARANASAL SINUSES \nAND MUCOUS RETENTION CYSTS\nThe  sinuses  commonly  affected  by  mucocele  in  the  \norder  of  frequency  are  the  frontal,  ethmoidal,  maxillary  \nand  sphenoidal.  There  are  two  views  in  the  genesis  of  a  \nmucocele:\n1. Chronic obstruction to sinus ostium resulting in accu-\nmulation of secretions which slowly expand the sinus \nand destroy its bony walls.\n2. Cystic dilatation of mucous gland of the sinus muco-\nsa  due  to  obstruction  of  its  duct.  In  this  case,  wall  of  \nmucocele is surrounded by normal sinus mucosa. The \ncontents of mucocele are sterile.\nMucocele  of  the  frontal  sinus  (Figure  38.2)  usually  pre-\nsents in the superomedial quadrant of the orbit (90%) and \ndisplaces  the  eyeball  forward,  downward  and  laterally.  \nThe swelling is cystic and nontender; egg-shell crackling \nmay be elicited. Sometimes, it presents as a cystic swelling \nin  the  forehead  (10%).  Patient’s  complaints  are  usually  \nmild and may include headache, diplopia and proptosis. \nImaging  of  the  frontal  sinus  usually  reveals  clouding  of  \nthe sinus with loss of scalloped outline which is so typical \nof the normal frontal sinus (see Figure 38.3). Treatment is \nfrontoethmoidectomy with free drainage of frontal sinus \ninto the middle meatus.\nMucocele  of  ethmoid  sinuses  causes  expansion  of  the  \nmedial  wall  of  the  orbit,  displacing  the  eyeball  forward  \nand  laterally.  In  addition,  it  may  cause  a  bulge  in  the  \nmiddle  meatus  of  nose.  A  mucocele  of  the  ethmoid  can  \nbe  drained  by  an  intranasal  operation,  uncapping  the  \nethmoidal  bulge  and  establishing  free  drainage.  Some-\ntimes, it may require external ethmoid operation.\nMucous retention cyst of the maxillary sinus presents as a \nretention cyst due to obstruction of the duct of seromu-\ncinous gland and usually does not cause bone erosion. It \nis  asymptomatic  and  is  observed  as  an  incidental  find-\ning  on  radiographs.  No  treatment  is  generally  required  \nfor asymptomatic retention cysts as most of them regress \nspontaneously over a period of time.\nMucocele  of  the  maxillary  sinus  can  occur  as  a  compli-\ncation of chronic sinus inflammation when its ostium is \nblocked.  The  sinus  fills  with  mucus  and  its  bony  walls  \nget expanded due to expansile process. CT scan and MRI \ncan help in the diagnosis. A polyp, tumour or trauma in \nthe middle meatus may also obstruct the sinus ostium to \ncause a mucocele.\nMucocele of sphenoid sinus or sphenoethmoidal mucocele \narises from slow expansion and destruction of sphenoid \nand posterior ethmoid sinuses. Clinical features are those \nof superior orbital fissure syndrome (involvement of CN \nIII,  IV,  VI  and  ophthalmic  division  of  V)  or  orbital  apex  \nsyndrome which is superior orbital fissure syndrome with \nadditional  involvement  of  optic  and  maxillary  division  \nof trigeminal nerve. Exophthalmos is always present and \nthe pain is localized to the orbit or forehead. Some may \ncomplain of headache in the occiput or vertex. Treatment \nis  external  ethmoidectomy  with  sphenoidotomy.  Ante-\nrior wall of the sphenoid sinus is removed, cyst wall un-\ncapped and its fluid contents evacuated.\nPyocele  or  mucopyocele  is  similar  to  mucocele  but  its  \ncontents  are  purulent.  It  can  result  from  infection  of  a  \nmucocele of any of the sinuses.\nEndoscopic surgery has replaced external operation of \nthe sinuses for treatment of all mucocele or mucopyoce-\nles of various sinuses.\nB. OSTEOMYELITIS\nOsteomyelitis is infection of bone marrow and should be \ndifferentiated from osteitis which is infection of the com-\npact  bone.  Osteomyelitis,  following  sinus  infection,  in-\nvolves either the maxilla or the frontal bone.\n1. Osteomyelitis of the maxilla. It is more often seen in \ninfants  and  children  than  adults  because  of  the  pres-\nence of spongy bone in the anterior wall of the maxilla. \nInfection  may  start  in  the  dental  sac  and  then  spread  \nto  the  maxilla,  but  less  often,  it  is  primary  infection  \nof  the  maxillary  sinus.  Clinical  features  are  erythema,  \nswelling of cheek, oedema of lower lid, purulent nasal \ndischarge  and  fever.  Subperiosteal  abscess  followed  by  \nfistulae  may  form  in  infraorbital  region  (Figure  38.4), \nalveolus or palate, or in zygoma. Sequestration of bone \nmay  occur.  Treatment  consists  of  large  doses  of  anti-\nbiotics,  drainage  of  any  abscess  and  removal  of  the  \nsequestra.\nOsteomyelitis of maxilla may cause damage to tem-\nporary  or  permanent  tooth-buds,  maldevelopment  of  \nmaxilla, oroantral fistula, persistently draining sinus or \nepiphora.\n2. Osteomyelitis of frontal bone (Figure 38.5). It is more \noften  seen  in  adults  as  frontal  sinus  is  not  developed  \nin infants and children. Osteomyelitis of frontal bone \nresults from acute infection of frontal sinus either di-\nrectly  or  through  the  venous  spread.  It  can  also  fol-\nlow trauma or surgery of frontal sinus in the presence \nof  acute  infection.  Pus  may  form  externally  under  \nmebooksfree.com",

Cystic dilatation of mucous gland of the sinus muco-\nsa  due  to  obstruction  of  its  duct.  In  this  case,  wall  of  \nmucocele is surrounded by normal sinus mucosa.

        "mucocele is surrounded by normal sinus mucosa. The \ncontents of mucocele are sterile.\nMucocele  of  the  frontal  sinus  (Figure  38.2)  usually  pre-\nsents in the superomedial quadrant of the orbit (90%) and \ndisplaces  the  eyeball  forward,  downward  and  laterally.  \nThe swelling is cystic and nontender; egg-shell crackling \nmay be elicited. Sometimes, it presents as a cystic swelling \nin  the  forehead  (10%).  Patient’s  complaints  are  usually  \nmild and may include headache, diplopia and proptosis. \nImaging  of  the  frontal  sinus  usually  reveals  clouding  of  \nthe sinus with loss of scalloped outline which is so typical \nof the normal frontal sinus (see Figure 38.3). Treatment is \nfrontoethmoidectomy with free drainage of frontal sinus \ninto the middle meatus.\nMucocele  of  ethmoid  sinuses  causes  expansion  of  the  \nmedial  wall  of  the  orbit,  displacing  the  eyeball  forward  \nand  laterally.

        "Mucocele  of  ethmoid  sinuses  causes  expansion  of  the  \nmedial  wall  of  the  orbit,  displacing  the  eyeball  forward  \nand  laterally.  In  addition,  it  may  cause  a  bulge  in  the  \nmiddle  meatus  of  nose.  A  mucocele  of  the  ethmoid  can  \nbe  drained  by  an  intranasal  operation,  uncapping  the  \nethmoidal  bulge  and  establishing  free  drainage.  Some-\ntimes, it may require external ethmoid operation.\nMucous retention cyst of the maxillary sinus presents as a \nretention cyst due to obstruction of the duct of seromu-\ncinous gland and usually does not cause bone erosion. It \nis  asymptomatic  and  is  observed  as  an  incidental  find-\ning  on  radiographs.  No  treatment  is  generally  required  \nfor asymptomatic retention cysts as most of them regress \nspontaneously over a period of time.\nMucocele  of  the  maxillary  sinus  can  occur  as  a  compli-\ncation of chronic sinus inflammation when its ostium is",
        "spontaneously over a period of time.\nMucocele  of  the  maxillary  sinus  can  occur  as  a  compli-\ncation of chronic sinus inflammation when its ostium is \nblocked.  The  sinus  fills  with  mucus  and  its  bony  walls  \nget expanded due to expansile process. CT scan and MRI \ncan help in the diagnosis. A polyp, tumour or trauma in \nthe middle meatus may also obstruct the sinus ostium to \ncause a mucocele.\nMucocele of sphenoid sinus or sphenoethmoidal mucocele \narises from slow expansion and destruction of sphenoid \nand posterior ethmoid sinuses. Clinical features are those \nof superior orbital fissure syndrome (involvement of CN \nIII,  IV,  VI  and  ophthalmic  division  of  V)  or  orbital  apex  \nsyndrome which is superior orbital fissure syndrome with \nadditional  involvement  of  optic  and  maxillary  division  \nof trigeminal nerve.

Some may \ncomplain of headache in the occiput or vertex. Treatment \nis  external  ethmoidectomy  with  sphenoidotomy.  Ante-\nrior wall of the sphenoid sinus is removed, cyst wall un-\ncapped and its fluid contents evacuated.\nPyocele  or  mucopyocele  is  similar  to  mucocele  but  its  \ncontents  are  purulent.  It  can  result  from  infection  of  a  \nmucocele of any of the sinuses.\nEndoscopic surgery has replaced external operation of \nthe sinuses for treatment of all mucocele or mucopyoce-\nles of various sinuses.\nB.

Pharyngitis  and  tonsillitis.  Hypertrophy  of  lateral  \nlymphoid  bands  behind  the  posterior  pillars  (lateral  \npharyngitis)  is  indicative  of  chronic  sinusitis.  It  may  \nbe unilateral and affect the side of the involved sinus. \nChronic sinusitis may also cause recurrent tonsillitis or \ngranular pharyngitis.\n3. Persistent laryngitis and tracheobronchitis. Sinusitis \nmay  be  associated  with  recurrent  laryngitis,  bronchi-\nectasis  and  asthma  but  the  latter  are  not  necessarily  \ncaused by sinusitis.\nV. FOCAL INFECTIONS\nThe role of sinus infection to act as focus of infection is \ndoubtful. A few conditions such as polyarthritis, tenosyn-\novitis, fibrositis and certain skin diseases may respond to \nelimination  of  infection  in  the  sinuses.

The  \nmass  increases  in  size  on  crying  or  straining.  Unless  \ncare  is  taken,  it  may  be  misdiagnosed  as  a  simple  polyp  \nand  mistakenly  avulsed,  resulting  in  cerebrospinal  fluid  \nrhinorrhoea  or  meningitis.  For  the  same  reason  biopsy  \nshould not be taken. CT scan is essential to demonstrate \na defect in the base of skull. Treatment is frontal cranioto-\nmy, severing the stalk from the brain, and repair of dural \nand bony defect. Intranasal mass is removed as secondary \nprocedure after cranial defect has sealed (endoscopic).\n10.  gliomas.  Of  all  the  gliomas,  60%  are  extranasal,  \n30%  are  intranasal  and  10%  both  intra  and  extranasal.  \nThey are seen in infants and children. An intranasal glio-\nma presents as a firm polyp sometimes protruding at the \nanterior nares.\n11.  nasal  dermoid.  It  presents  as  widening  of  upper  \npart  of  nasal  septum  with  splaying  of  nasal  bones  and  \nhypertelorism. A pit or a sinus may be seen in the midline \nof nasal dorsum with hair protruding from the opening.\nMALIGNANT NEOPLASMS\n1.  carcinoma oF nasal caVity. Primary carcinoma per \nse is rare. It may be an extension of maxillary or ethmoid \ncarcinoma.  Squamous  cell  variety  is  the  most  common,  \nseen  in  about  80%  of  cases.  Rest  may  be  adenoid  cystic  \ncarcinoma or an adenocarcinoma.\n(a)    Squamous  cell  carcinoma.  It  may  arise  from  the  vesti-\nbule, anterior part of nasal septum or the lateral wall \nof  nasal  cavity.  Most  of  them  are  seen  in  men  past  \n50 years of age.\n(i)    Vestibular.  It  arises  from  the  lateral  wall  of  na-\nsal vestibule and may extend into the columella, \nnasal floor and upper lip with metastases to pa-\nrotid nodes.\n(ii)     Septal.  Mostly  arises  from  mucocutaneous  junc-\ntion and causes burning and soreness in the nose. \nIt  has  often  been  termed  “nose-picker’s  cancer.” \nUsually, it is of low-grade malignancy.\n(iii)   Lateral wall. This is the site most commonly in-\nvolved. Easily extends into ethmoid or maxillary \nsinuses.  Grossly,  it  presents  as  a  polypoid  mass  \nin  the  lateral  wall  of  nose.  Metastases  are  rare.  \nTreatment  is  combination  of  radiotherapy  and  \nsurgery.\n(b)    Adenocarcinoma  and  adenoid  cystic  carcinoma.  They  \narise from the glands of mucous membrane or minor \nsalivary glands and mostly involve upper part of the \nlateral wall of nasal cavity.\n2.    malignant melanoma. Usually seen in persons about \n50  years  of  age.  Both  sexes  are  equally  affected.  Grossly,  \nit  presents  as  a  slaty-grey  or  bluish-black  polypoid  mass.  \nWithin  the  nasal  cavity,  most  frequent  site  is  anterior  \npart of nasal septum followed by middle and inferior tur-\nbinate.  Amelanotic  varieties  are  nonpigmented.  Tumour  \nspreads  by  lymphatics  and  blood  stream.  Cervical  nodal  \nmetastases may be present at the time of initial examina-\ntion. Treatment is wide surgical excision. Immunological \ndefences of the patient play a great role in the control of \nthis disease. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy suppress the \nimmune processes and are avoided. A 5-year survival rate \nof 30% can be expected after wide surgical excision.\n3.  esthesioneuroblastoma  (syn.  olF  actory  neu-\nroblastoma).   Also   called   olfactory   placode   tumour   \nas  it  arises  from  the  olfactory  epithelium  in  the  upper  \nthird  of  nose.  Bimodal  peaks  of  incidence  at  10–20  and  \n50–60  years  are  seen.  Most  common  symptoms  are  uni-\nlateral  nasal  obstruction  and  epistaxis.  When  tumour  \ninvades   orbit   and   the   surrounding   structures,   other   \nsymptoms  like  proptosis,  headache,  epiphora,  diplopia  \nand blurred vision can also arise. Lymph node metastases \nin the neck can occur in 10–15%.\nIntranasal  or  endoscopic  examination  of  nose  reveals  \na friable cherry-red, polypoidal mass in the upper third of \nnasal cavity.

      "content": "245\nChapter 43\nCommon Disorders of Oral Cavity\nULCERS OF ORAL CAVITY\nSome  of  the  common  ulcers  are  described  in  this  chap-\nter.  The  causes  of  the  ulcers  of  oral  cavity  are  listed  in  \nTable 43.1.\nA. INFECTION\nViral\n1.  herpangina.  It  is  a  coxsackie  viral  infection  mostly  \naffecting children. To begin with, multiple small vesicles \nappear on the faucial pillars, tonsils, soft palate and uvu-\nla. They rupture to form ulcers which are usually 2-4 mm \nin size, have a yellow base and red areola around them. \nThey seldom persist beyond 1 week.\n2.  herpetic gingiVostomatitis. Also known as orola-\nbial herpes. It is caused by herpes simplex virus and is of \ntwo types: primary and secondary.\n(a)  The  primary infection affects children and is character-\nized by clusters of multiple vesicles which soon rup-\nture to form ulcers. Any part of the oral cavity may be \naffected. Constitutional symptoms like fever, malaise \nand  headache  may  accompany  sore  throat  and  lym-\nphadenopathy.\n(b) Secondary  or  recurrent  herpes  chiefly  affects  adults.  It  \nis  milder  in  form  as  adults  have  some  immunity  to  \nthis virus. Most commonly, it involves the vermilion \nborder of the lip (herpes labialis) but less often lesions \nappear intraorally on the hard palate and gingiva. In \nrecurrent  herpes,  it  is  presumed  that  virus  lies  dor-\nmant in the trigeminal ganglion and, when reactivat-\ned, travels along peripheral sensory nerves to involve \noropharyngeal  mucosa.  Precipitating  factors  include  \nemotional stress, fatigue, fever, pregnancy or immune \ndeficiency  states.  Treatment  is  mostly  symptomatic.  \nAcyclovir, 200 mg, five times a day for 5 days helps to \ncut down the course of recurrent herpes labialis.\n3.  hand,  Foot and  mouth  disease.  It  is  also  a  viral  \ninfection affecting children. Oral lesions are seen on the \npalate, tongue and buccal mucosa. Vesicles also develop \non the skin of hands, feet and sometimes buttocks.\nBacterial\n1.  Vincent  inFection  (Acute NecrotiziNg  ulcerAtive \ngiNgivitis). It is similar to Vincent’s angina. Causative or-\nganisms are the same (a fusiform bacillus and a spirochaete-\nBorrelia  vincentii).  More  often  the  disease  affects  young  \nadults and middle-aged persons. It starts at the interdental \npapillae  and  then  spreads  to  free  margins  of  the  gingivae  \nwhich  get  covered  with  necrotic  slough.  Gingivae  also  \nbecome  red  and  oedematous.  Similar  ulcer  and  necrotic  \nmembrane may also form over the tonsil (Vincent’s angina). \nDiagnosis is made by smear from the affected area. Treat-\nment  is  systemic  antibiotics  (penicillin  or  erythromycin  \nand metronidazole), frequent mouth washes (with sodium \nbicarbonate solution) and attention to dental hygiene.\n2.  speciFic bacterial inFections. Tuberculosis, syphi-\nlis and actinomycosis may present as chronic ulcers.\nFungal\nMoniLiaSiS  (canDiDiaSiS). It  is  caused  by Candida \nalbicans and occurs in two forms:\n1. Thrush.  It  appears  as  white  grey  patches  on  the  oral  \nmucosa  and  tongue.  When  wiped  off,  they  leave  an  \nerythematous  mucosa.  The  condition  is  seen  in  in-\nfants and children. Adults are also affected when they \nare suffering from systemic malignancy and diabetes \nor taking broad-spectrum antibiotics, cytotoxic drugs, \nsteroids or radiation.\n2. Chronic  hypertrophic  candidiasis.  Also  called  candidal \nleukoplakia.  The  lesion  appears  as  white  patch  which  \ncannot  be  wiped  off.  Mostly  affects  anterior  buccal  \nmucosa just behind the angle of mouth.\nThrush can be treated by topical application of nysta-\ntin  or  clotrimazole.  Hypertrophic  form  usually  requires  \nexcisional surgery.\nTABLE 43.1   CAUSES OF ULCERS OF THE ORAL \nCAVITY\n1. Infections\n(a)    Viral. Herpangina, herpes simplex (primary and secondary), \nhand, foot and mouth disease\n(b) Bacterial. Vincent infection, TB, syphilis\n(c) Fungal. Candidiasis\n2. Immune disorders. Aphthous ulcer, Behçet syndrome\n3. Trauma\n(a) Physical. Cheek bite, jagged tooth, ill-fitting denture\n(b) Chemical. Silver nitrate, phenol, aspirin burns\n(c) Thermal. Hot food or fluid, reverse smoking\n4. Neoplasms\n5. Skin disorders. Erythema multiforme, lichen planus, benign \nmucous membrane pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, lupus \nerythematosus\n6. Blood disorders. Leukaemia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, \ncyclic neutropenia, sickle cell anaemia\n7. Drug allergy. Mouth washes, toothpaste, etc. Reactions to \nsystemic drugs\n8.

The  causes  of  the  ulcers  of  oral  cavity  are  listed  in  \nTable 43.1.\nA. INFECTION\nViral\n1.  herpangina.  It  is  a  coxsackie  viral  infection  mostly  \naffecting children. To begin with, multiple small vesicles \nappear on the faucial pillars, tonsils, soft palate and uvu-\nla. They rupture to form ulcers which are usually 2-4 mm \nin size, have a yellow base and red areola around them. \nThey seldom persist beyond 1 week.\n2.  herpetic gingiVostomatitis. Also known as orola-\nbial herpes. It is caused by herpes simplex virus and is of \ntwo types: primary and secondary.\n(a)  The  primary infection affects children and is character-\nized by clusters of multiple vesicles which soon rup-\nture to form ulcers. Any part of the oral cavity may be \naffected. Constitutional symptoms like fever, malaise",

Constitutional symptoms like fever, malaise \nand  headache  may  accompany  sore  throat  and  lym-\nphadenopathy.\n(b) Secondary  or  recurrent  herpes  chiefly  affects  adults.  It  \nis  milder  in  form  as  adults  have  some  immunity  to  \nthis virus. Most commonly, it involves the vermilion \nborder of the lip (herpes labialis) but less often lesions \nappear intraorally on the hard palate and gingiva. In \nrecurrent  herpes,  it  is  presumed  that  virus  lies  dor-\nmant in the trigeminal ganglion and, when reactivat-\ned, travels along peripheral sensory nerves to involve \noropharyngeal  mucosa.  Precipitating  factors  include  \nemotional stress, fatigue, fever, pregnancy or immune \ndeficiency  states.  Treatment  is  mostly  symptomatic.  \nAcyclovir, 200 mg, five times a day for 5 days helps to \ncut down the course of recurrent herpes labialis.",

Treatment  is  mostly  symptomatic.  \nAcyclovir, 200 mg, five times a day for 5 days helps to \ncut down the course of recurrent herpes labialis.\n3.  hand,  Foot and  mouth  disease.  It  is  also  a  viral  \ninfection affecting children. Oral lesions are seen on the \npalate, tongue and buccal mucosa. Vesicles also develop \non the skin of hands, feet and sometimes buttocks.\nBacterial\n1.  Vincent  inFection  (Acute NecrotiziNg  ulcerAtive \ngiNgivitis). It is similar to Vincent’s angina. Causative or-\nganisms are the same (a fusiform bacillus and a spirochaete-\nBorrelia  vincentii).  More  often  the  disease  affects  young  \nadults and middle-aged persons. It starts at the interdental \npapillae  and  then  spreads  to  free  margins  of  the  gingivae  \nwhich  get  covered  with  necrotic  slough.  Gingivae  also  \nbecome  red  and  oedematous.  Similar  ulcer  and  necrotic  \nmembrane may also form over the tonsil (Vincent’s angina).",

Similar  ulcer  and  necrotic  \nmembrane may also form over the tonsil (Vincent’s angina). \nDiagnosis is made by smear from the affected area. Treat-\nment  is  systemic  antibiotics  (penicillin  or  erythromycin  \nand metronidazole), frequent mouth washes (with sodium \nbicarbonate solution) and attention to dental hygiene.\n2.  speciFic bacterial inFections. Tuberculosis, syphi-\nlis and actinomycosis may present as chronic ulcers.\nFungal\nMoniLiaSiS  (canDiDiaSiS). It  is  caused  by Candida \nalbicans and occurs in two forms:\n1. Thrush.  It  appears  as  white  grey  patches  on  the  oral  \nmucosa  and  tongue.  When  wiped  off,  they  leave  an  \nerythematous  mucosa.  The  condition  is  seen  in  in-\nfants and children. Adults are also affected when they \nare suffering from systemic malignancy and diabetes \nor taking broad-spectrum antibiotics, cytotoxic drugs, \nsteroids or radiation.",

Adults are also affected when they \nare suffering from systemic malignancy and diabetes \nor taking broad-spectrum antibiotics, cytotoxic drugs, \nsteroids or radiation.\n2. Chronic  hypertrophic  candidiasis.  Also  called  candidal \nleukoplakia.  The  lesion  appears  as  white  patch  which  \ncannot  be  wiped  off.  Mostly  affects  anterior  buccal  \nmucosa just behind the angle of mouth.\nThrush can be treated by topical application of nysta-\ntin  or  clotrimazole.  Hypertrophic  form  usually  requires  \nexcisional surgery.\nTABLE 43.1   CAUSES OF ULCERS OF THE ORAL \nCAVITY\n1. Infections\n(a)    Viral.

They are recurrent and superficial, \nusually  involving  movable  mucosa,  i.e.  inner  surfaces  of  \nlips, buccal mucosa, tongue, floor of mouth and soft palate, \nwhile  sparing  mucosa  of  the  hard  palate  and  gingivae.  In  \nthe minor form, which is more common, ulcers are 2-10 mm \nin size and multiple with a central necrotic area and a red \nhalo (Figure 43.1). They heal in about 2 weeks without leav-\ning a scar. In the major form, ulcer is very big, 2-4 cm in size \nand heals with a scar but is soon followed by another ulcer.\nAetiology of aphthous ulcers is unknown. It may be an \nautoimmune process, nutritional deficiency (vitamin B\n12\n, \nfolic acid and iron), viral or bacterial infection, food aller-\ngies or due to hormonal changes or stress.\nAphthous ulcers can be differentiated from viral ulcers \nby  their  frequent  recurrence,  involvement  of  movable  \nmucosa as on the soft palate or cheek, and the absence of \nconstitutional symptoms like fever, malaise and enlarge-\nment of cervical nodes.\nTreatment  consists  of  topical  application  of  steroids  \nand cauterization with 10% silver nitrate. In severe cases, \n250 mg of tetracycline dissolved in 50 mL of water is giv-\nen as mouth rinse and then to be swallowed, four times \na day. Local pain can be relieved with lignocaine viscous.\n2.  behçet syndrome (oculo-oro-geNitAl syNdrome). \nIt is characterized by a triad of (i) aphthous-like ulcers in \nthe oral cavity, (ii) enital ulcerations and (iii) uveitis. The \nedge of the ulcer is characteristically punched out. There \nmay also be lesions of the skin, joints and central nervous \nsystem.\nC. TRAUMA\nTraumatic ulcer. A traumatic ulcer on the lateral border \nof  tongue  may  be  due  to  jagged  tooth  or  ill-fitting  den-\nture, on the buccal mucosa due to cheek bite and on the \npalate due to injury with a foreign object such as pencil \nor toothbrush (Figures 43.2 and 43.3).\nSimilarly,  acute  ulcerative  lesions  of  oral  and  oro-\npharyngeal mucosa can result from accidental ingestion \nof acids or alkalies or hot fluids.\nAspirin burn is seen in the buccal sulcus when a tablet \nof aspirin is kept against a painful tooth to get relief from \ntoothache.\nD. NEOPLASMS\nMalignancies  of  the  oral  cavity  or  oropharynx  may  pre-\nsent as chronic ulcers. Though most commonly it is squa-\nmous cell carcinoma, it could be carcinoma of minor sali-\nvary glands or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nE. SKIN DISORDERS\n1.  erythema  multiForme.  It  is  a  disease  of  rapid  on-\nset involving the skin and mucous membranes, either of \nwhich may be involved alone. The aetiology is unknown \nbut may be associated with drug allergy (sulfonamides) or \nrecent herpes simplex infection. Oral mucosal lesions con-\nsist of vesicles or bullae which soon rupture to form ulcers \ncovered with pseudomembrane. Any area of oral mucosa \nis involved but the common sites are lips, buccal mucosa \nand tongue. The lesions bleed easily. The distinctive fea-\nture  is  to  form  haemorrhagic  crusts  on  the  lips.  Skin  le-\nsions consist of erythematous patches on the palms, soles \nand extensor surfaces of the extremities. Oral lesions may \noccur without skin involvement in 25% of patients. The \ndisease  is  self-limiting  and  management  is  mainly  sup-\nportive. Steroids are used to treat the severe form.\n2.  pemphigus  Vulgaris.  It  is  an  autoimmune  disorder  \naffecting  older  age  group  (50-70  years).  Oral  lesions  are  \nseen in 50% of the cases and may precede skin lesions.\nOral ulcerations are superficial and involve palate, buc-\ncal  mucosa  and  tongue.  Treatment  consists  of  systemic  \nsteroids and cytotoxic drugs.\n3. benign mucous membrane pemphigoid (bmmp). \nIt  is  also  an  autoimmune  disorder.  Mucosal  lesions  in-\nvolve cheek, gingivae and palate. Conjunctiva is the next \nimportant  site.  Lesion  starts  as  a  bulla  filled  with  clear  \nor haemorrhagic fluid which ruptures to form superficial \nFigure 43.1.

It  is  red  rhomboid  \narea, devoid of papillae, seen on the dorsum of tongue in \nfront of foramen caecum. It is a developmental anomaly \nthat occurs due to persistence of tuberculum impar, which \nfails  to  invaginate.  Recent  studies  reveal  this  condition  \nto be due to chronic candida infection. The condition is \nasymptomatic and no treatment is necessary.\n2.  geographical  tongue.  It  is  characterized  by  ery-\nthematous areas, devoid of papillae, surrounded by an ir-\nregular keratotic white outline (Figure 43.5). The lesions \nkeep  changing  their  shape  and  hence  the  condition  is  \nalso called “migratory glossitis.” The condition is asymp-\ntomatic and may not require any treatment.\n3.  hairy  tongue.  Due  to  excessive  formation  of  kera-\ntin,  the  filiform  papillae  on  the  dorsum  of  the  tongue  \nbecome  elongated.  They  get  coloured,  brown  or  black,  \ndue  to  chromogenic  bacteria  and  look  like  hair.  Smok-\ning seems to be one of the factors. Treatment consists of \nscraping the lesions with a tongue cleaner, application of \nhalf-strength hydrogen peroxide and improving the gen-\neral nutritional status of the patient by vitamins. Causa-\ntive factors, if known, should be removed.\n4.   Fissured  tongue.  It  may  be  congenital  or  seen  in  \ncases of syphilis, deficiency of vitamin B complex or anae-\nmia. Congenital fissuring associated facial palsy is seen in \nMelkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.\n5.  ankyloglossia  (tongue  tie)  (Figure  43.6).  True  \ntongue  tie  which  produces  symptoms  is  uncommon.  If  \ntongue can be protruded beyond the lower incisors, it is \nunlikely to cause speech defects. A mobile tongue is im-\nportant  to  maintain  orodental  hygiene-to  clean  the  de-\nbris and prevent formation of dental plaques. Treatment \nof any significant tongue tie is transverse release and ver-\ntical closure. Thin mucosal folds can be simply incised.\n6.  Fordyce  spots.  They  are  aberrant  sebaceous  glands  \npresent  under  the  buccal  or  labial  mucosa  and  shine  \nthrough  it  as  yellowish  or  yellow-brown  spots.  They  are  \nseen with equal frequency in both males and females and \nare considered normal.\n7. nicotine stomatitis. This disorder is seen in smokers \nparticularly those in the habit of reverse smoking. Palatal \nmucosa  shows  pin-point  red  spots  in  the  centre  of  um-\nbilicated  papular  lesions.  They  are  due  to  inflammation  \nof the minor salivary glands and their duct openings as a \nreaction to the heat of the smoke. The nicotine stomatitis \nis a misnomer as nicotine is not the cause. Management \nis elimination of smoking.\nSUBMUCOUS FIBROSIS\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic insidious pro-\ncess characterized by juxtaepithelial deposition of fibrous \ntissue in the oral cavity and pharynx. The condition was \nfirst  described  in  India  by  Joshi  in  1953.  The  disease  is  \nwidely  seen  in  India,  Pakistan,  Taiwan,  Sri  Lanka,  Nepal  \nand Thailand due to habit of betel-nut chewing.\nAETIOLOGY\n1. Socioeconomic status. In India, poor socioeconomic \nstatus  has  been  associated  with  higher  risk  of  pre-\ncancerous lesions like leukoplakia, erythroplakia and \nsubmucous fibrosis. This is related to education, diet, \nlifestyle and access to medical care.\n2. Tobacco  chewing.  It  is  a  major  risk  factor  in  sub-\nmucous  fibrosis  as  it  is  in  lesions  of  leukoplakia  and  \nerythroplakia.\n3. Areca nuts. Areca nuts are chewed alone, with tobac-\nco or in the form of pan (containing lime, catechu and \nother ingredients on a betel leaf). Betel quid without \ntobacco  also  increases  the  risk  of  oral  precancerous  \nlesions, but causes higher risk for oral submucous fi-\nbrosis  relative  to  leukoplakia,  erythroplakia  or  mul-\ntiple  precancerous  lesions.  International  agency  for  \nresearch  on  cancer  has  classified  betel  quid  without  \ntobacco also as a carcinogen for humans.\n4. Alcohol. It is observed that drinking increases the risk \nof leukoplakia by 1.5-fold, OSF by 2-fold and that of \nerythroplakia by 3-fold.\nFigure 43.5. Geographical tongue.\nFigure 43.6.

Immune  process.  OSF  is  considered  a  cell-mediated  \nimmune  reaction  to  arecoline  in  areca  nuts.  It  may  \nalso reflect a localized collagen disorder or an autoim-\nmune process in the oral cavity.\n7. Multifactorial.  Several  factors  may  operate  together  \nin  the  causation  of  OSF.  Habit  of  betel-nut  chewing,  \ndrinking or smoking tobacco coupled with dietary de-\nficiencies may have synergistic effect.\nPATHOGENESIS\nHistopathology  in  early  cases  of  OSF  shows  presence  of  \npolymorphonuclear  leukocytes,  eosinophils  and  a  few  \nlymphocytes  while  advanced  cases  show  lymphocytes  \nand  plasma  cells.  Immunochemistry  of  inflammatory  \ncells  showed  higher  population  of  activated  T-lympho-\ncytes  especially  the  T-helper/inducer  lymphocytes  but  \nminor  population  of  B-cells  and  macrophages.  Later  \nstudies  also  showed  significant  increase  in  number  of  \nT-lymphocytes,  macrophages  and  high  CD4+  to  CD8+  \nlymphocyte  ratio  in  the  subepithelial  connective  tissue  \nsuggesting that OSF is a cellular immune response. Small \nnumber of B-lymphocytes suggests minor role of humoral \nimmunity  in  OSF.  In  advanced  stages,  there  was  severe  \nfibrosis and loss of vascularity in the lamina propria and \nsubmucosa. The process may extend deeper into muscle \nlayers  also.  Activated  macrophages  and  T-lymphocytes  \nproduce fibrogenic cytokines which act on mesenchymal \ncells to produce fibrosis. Also certain cytokines liberated \nby  T-lymphocytes  upregulate  synthesis  of  collagen  but  \ndownregulate collagenase production further promoting \nfibrosis.  It  is  thus  believed  that  OSF  is  due  to  increased  \nproduction  of  collagen  and  its  decreased  degradation  in  \nsubepithelial layers of the oral mucosa (Figure 43.7).\nPATHOLOGY\nThe basic change is fibroelastotic transformation of con-\nnective tissues in lamina propria associated with epithe-\nlial atrophy, sometimes preceded by vesicle formation. In \nlater stages, when fibrosis is marked, there is progressive \ntrismus and difficulty to protrude the tongue.\nLeukoplakia  and  squamous  cell  carcinoma  may  be  \nassociated  with  submucous  fibrosis  possibly  because  of  \ncommon aetiological factors involved.\nIt is a premalignant condition and malignant transfor-\nmation has been seen in 3-7.6% of cases.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\n1.  age anD Sex. No age or sex is immune but the dis-\nease mostly affects age group of 20-40 years.\n2. SyMPtoMS. Patient often presents with:\n(a) Intolerance to chillies and spicy food.\n(b)    Soreness of mouth with constant burning sensa-\ntion; worsened during meals particularly of pun-\ngent spicy type.\n(c)      Repeated  vesicular  eruption  on  the  palate  and  \npillars.\n(d) Difficulty to open the mouth fully.\n(e) Difficulty to protrude the tongue.\n3.   Findings.  Changes  of  submucous  fibrosis  are  most  \nmarked over (i) soft palate, (ii) faucial pillars and (iii) buc-\ncal mucosa (Figure 43.8). In initial stages, there is patchy \nredness of mucous membrane with formation of vesicles \nwhich rupture to form superficial ulcers.\nIn  later  stages,  when  fibrosis  develops  in  the  submu-\ncosal layers, there is blanching of mucosa with loss of sup-\npleness. Fibrotic bands can be seen and felt in the affected \nareas. Fibrosis and scarring has also been demonstrated in \nthe  underlying  muscle  leading  to  further  restrictive  mo-\nbility  of  soft  palate,  tongue  and  jaw.  Trismus  is  progres-\nsive, so much so that patient may not be able to put his \nfinger in the mouth or brush his teeth. Orodental hygiene \nis affected badly and teeth become carious. Examination \nof oral cavity is difficult particularly to rule out other as-\nsociated premalignant lesions or malignancy.\nTREATMENT\nMedical\n1. Steroids.

Peak incidence is in the third to fifth decades. Most of \nthem  appear  on  the  soft  and  hard  palate,  uvula,  tongue  \nand  lips.  Mostly  they  are  less  than  1  cm  in  size,  pedun-\nculated and white in colour. Their surface is irregular but \nsometimes smooth. Treatment is excisional biopsy. Recur-\nrence is rare.\n2. Fibroma  (Fibroepithelial  polyp).  It  is  a  smooth,  \nmucosa-covered   pedunculated   tumour,   usually   about   \n1  cm  in  size  and  soft  to  firm  in  consistency.  It  can  oc-\ncur  anywhere  in  the  oral  or  oropharyngeal  mucosa  \n(Figure  44.1).  The  usual  cause  is  chronic  irritation.  It  is  \neasily treated by conservative surgical excision.\n3. haemangioma.  Mucosal  haemangiomas  can  occur  \nin  the  oral  cavity  or  oropharynx  (Figure  44.2).  They  are  \nmostly  seen  in  children.  Three  types  of  haemangiomas  \nare known: capillary, cavernous and mixed.

Haemangiomas that \nare large and persistent or those which continue to grow \nare  problematic.  Use  of  cryosurgery  or  laser  is  not  pos-\nsible  in  large  diffuse  lesions.  Sclerotherapy  has  also  not  \nbeen found effective. However, microembolization alone \nor  as  a  preoperative  adjunct  to  surgery  has  been  found  \nvery useful.\n4. lymphangioma. Lymphangiomas mostly involve an-\nterior two-thirds of tongue. They may involve the tongue \ndiffusely  and  cause  macroglossia  or  may  present  as  lo-\ncalized soft swelling which is compressible. They do not \ninvolute spontaneously. Small lesions can be excised sur-\ngically. Symptomatic large lesions can be partially excised \nto reduce the bulk. Total excision of these lesions is not \npossible.\n5.  torus. It is a submucosal bony outgrowth. It may in-\nvolve the hard palate or mandible. Palatine torus is more \ncommon and presents as a narrow ridge, solitary nodule \nor a lobulated mass in the midline of the hard palate.\nMandibular tori project from the lingual aspect of the \ngingiva, near the bicuspid area and are bilateral. Tori are \ninnocuous and resection is indicated only when they in-\nterfere with speech, mastication or fitting of dentures.\n6. pyogenic  granuloma  (Figure  44.3).  It  is  a  reac-\ntive  granuloma  usually  occurs  in  response  to  trauma  or  \nchronic  irritation.  It  mostly  involves  anterior  gingivae  \nbut sometimes the other sites such as tongue, buccal mu-\ncosa or lips. Usually it is soft, smooth, reddish to purple \nmass  which  bleeds  on  touch.  Treatment  is  surgical  exci-\nsion. Recurrence is unlikely after complete excision.\n7. pregnancy  granuloma.  It  is  clinically  and  his-\ntologically  similar  to  pyogenic  granuloma.  It  usually  \nstarts  in  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  and  regresses  \nonce pregnancy has ended. It is excised only if it persists \nafter  pregnancy.  It  is  likely  to  recur  if  operated  during  \npregnancy.\n8.  granular cell myoblastoma or granular cell \ntumour. Most of these tumours occur in the oral cavity \nand  the  site  of  predilection  is  tongue.  Earlier  they  were  \nthought  to  arise  from  the  muscle  (hence  called  myo-\nblastoma)  but  are  now  considered  to  be  derived  from  \nSchwann cells. The tumour presents as a firm submucosal \nnodule.  Treatment  is  conservative  surgical  excision.

Microscopically,  it  consists  of  spindle  cells  with  \nhaemorrhagic cleft-like spaces. Treatment is not satisfac-\ntory. Kaposi sarcoma in non-AIDS patients may respond \nto  chemotherapy  but  its  response  in  patients  suffering  \nfrom AIDS is poor (see also p. 423).\nCHEMOPREVENTION\nIt is the use of certain pharmacological agents to halt, delay \nor reverse the process of carcinogenesis. It has been used to \nprevent oral premalignant lesions to develop into cancer \nor to prevent the development of second primary cancers \nafter  the  main  primary  cancer  has  been  treated.  Agents  \nused have been vitamin A, beta carotene, alpha tocopher-\nol (vitamin E), selenium and natural or synthetic retinoids \nsuch as 13-cis retinoic acid. Beta carotene and vitamin A \ninduced remission of oral leukoplakia is seen in 25–50% of \npatients. Similarly, in a controlled trial, 13-cis retinoic acid \nreduced  the  incidence  of  second  primary  lesions  in  the  \naerodigestive  tract.  The  beneficial  effect  of  these  agents  \nmay be limited to the duration of treatment only.\nIn  addition  to  their  use  in  head  and  neck,  retinoids  \nhave shown significant chemopreventive activity in can-\ncers of lung, skin, cervix, bladder and ovary. Trials are also \nbeing  conducted  in  Cox-2  inhibitors  (e.g.  celecoxib)  in  \nthe prevention of oral premalignant lesions.\nmebooksfree.com",

Kaposi sarcoma in non-AIDS patients may respond \nto  chemotherapy  but  its  response  in  patients  suffering  \nfrom AIDS is poor (see also p. 423).\nCHEMOPREVENTION\nIt is the use of certain pharmacological agents to halt, delay \nor reverse the process of carcinogenesis. It has been used to \nprevent oral premalignant lesions to develop into cancer \nor to prevent the development of second primary cancers \nafter  the  main  primary  cancer  has  been  treated.  Agents  \nused have been vitamin A, beta carotene, alpha tocopher-\nol (vitamin E), selenium and natural or synthetic retinoids \nsuch as 13-cis retinoic acid. Beta carotene and vitamin A \ninduced remission of oral leukoplakia is seen in 25–50% of \npatients.

Disease is \ncontracted by droplet infection and fomites. Children are \nmost often affected but adults can also contract the dis-\nease. Incubation period is 2–3 weeks (7–23 days). Patient \nis infective even before the appearance of clinical mani-\nfestations  and  remains  so  7–10  days  after  parotid  swell-\ning subsides. Virus is excreted through salivary, nasal and \nurinary excretions.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nThe  initial  period  of  viraemia  causes  fever  (up  to  103°F  \nor 39.4°C), malaise, anorexia and muscular pains. Parot-\nid  swelling  may  appear  only  on  one  side.  Other  parotid  \ngland may be enlarged simultaneously or after some time. \nSubmandibular  and  sublingual  salivary  glands  may  also  \nbe  enlarged  but  isolated  involvement  of  submandibular  \ngland is rare. Swelling subsides in about a week.\nCOMPLICATIONS\n•\tOrchitis with painful and tender testis, on one but un-\ncommonly  both  sides,  may  occur.  Sterility  following  \nmumps is rare.\n•\tOphritis causes lower abdominal pain. Female sterility \nis almost never seen.\n•\tPancreatitis causes pain in abdomen.\n•\tAseptic  meningitis  or  meningoencephalitis  may  occur  \nwith or without the salivary gland involvement. Head-\naches, neck stiffness and drowsiness may occur.\n•\tUnilateral sensorineural hearing loss can occur due to in-\nvolvement of the labyrinth. Sudden deafness has been \nnoticed.\n•\tOther  complications  include  thyroiditis,  myocarditis,  \nnephritis and arthritis.\nDIAGNOSIS\nUsually  clinical;  difficulties  arise  when  parotids  are  not  \nenlarged.\n1. Serum and urinary amylase are raised during the first \nweek of parotitis.\n2. Serology.  Serum  IgG  and  IgM  are  measured  as  early  as  \npossible  and  after  10–14  days  of  illness.  Presence  of  \nIgG  indicates  past  exposure  and  possible  immunity.  \nHowever  rise  in  IgG  titre  more  than  four  times  from  \nacute to convalescent serum indicates recent infection. \nSimilarly  presence  of  IgM  also  indicates  recent  infec-\ntion. IgM is present in 100% patients by day 5.\nTREATMENT\nParotitis  is  treated  by  proper  hydration,  rest,  analgesics  \nand  cold  or  hot  compresses  over  the  parotid  to  relieve  \npain.  Food  which  encourages  salivary  flow  should  be  \navoided  as  they  cause  pain.  Parotid  swelling  persists  for  \nabout 1 week.\nOrchitis is treated by cold compresses and support to \nthe  scrotum,  and  administration  of  analgesics.  Steroids  \nhave not been found useful.\nPREVENTION\nAn  infant  has  maternal  immunity  for  1  year.  After  that  \nimmunization  can  be  given  by  MMR  (Mumps,  Measles,  \nRubella) vaccine at the age of 15 months.

Dry mouth due to any cause is a pre-\ndisposing factor. Staphylococcus aureus is the usual causa-\ntive organism though other Gram-positive and anaerobic \norganisms have also been observed. Usual route of infec-\ntion is from the mouth through the Stensen’s duct.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nThe  onset  is  sudden  with  severe  pain  and  enlargement  \nof  gland  (Figure  45.1).  Movements  of  jaw  aggravate  the  \npain.  Opening  of  the  Stensen’s  duct  is  swollen  and  red  \nand may be discharging pus or the latter can also be ex-\npressed by gentle pressure over the gland.

It may be primary \nor secondary.\n1. Primary  Sjogren’s  syndrome  consists  of  xerostomia  and  \nxerophthalmia  and  is  due  to  involvement  of  salivary  \nand lacrimal glands. Parotid is the most often involved \ngland.  It  has  also  been  called  as  benign  lymphoepithe-\nlial lesion of parotid or Mikulicz’s disease. Both sexes are \nequally involved.\n2. Secondary  Sjogren’s  syndrome  consists  of  three  major  \ncomponents:  (i)  keratoconjunctivitis  sicca  (due  to  in-\nvolvement  of  lacrimal  gland);  (ii)  xerostomia  (due  to  \ninvolvement  of  salivary  glands  and  minor  mucous  \nglands  of  the  oral  cavity);  (iii)  autoimmune  connec-\ntive  tissue  disorder,  usually  the  rheumatoid  arthritis,  \nsometimes the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In \nscleroderma or polymyositis, there is often a bilateral \nswelling of the salivary glands. Moreover, 90% of the \ncases occur in females. Sjogren’s syndrome histopatho-\nlogically  shows  destruction  of  acini  and  lymphocytic  \ninfiltration and has therefore earned the name of lym-\nphoepithelial lesion.\nDiagnosis depends on the history and physical exami-\nnation of keratoconjunctivitis and xerostomia. Schirmer’s \ntest may be done to prove decreased tear formation. Biop-\nsy of the lower lip is performed to determine the involve-\nment of minor salivary glands.

Raised  erythrocyte  sedimenta-\ntion rate, positive rheumatoid factor and positive antinuclear \nantibodies tests help to exclude associated rheumatoid ar-\nthritis or SLE.\nSIALOMETAPLASIA\nIt  is  an  important  condition  that  simulates  carcinoma.  \nMost often it involves minor salivary glands in the palate \nbut may occur in major salivary glands, nose or nasophar-\nynx. It may present as a swelling or an ulcerated lesion, \nusually  involving  males  in  their  forties.  Histologically  \nthere  is  destruction  of  acini  with  squamous  metaplasia  \n(pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia).\nDiagnosis  is  made  by  biopsy  and  differentiating  \nit  from  squamons  cell  or  mucoepidermoid  carcino-\nma.

In  the  parotid  it  usually  arises  \nfrom its tail. It can also arise from the deep lobe of the \nparotid  and  present  as  a  parapharyngeal  tumour  in  the  \noropharynx.\nPleomorphic adenomas are slow-growing tumours and \nmay  be  quite  large  at  initial  presentation.  They  are  usu-\nally  seen  in  the  third  or  fourth  decade,  with  propensity  \nfor females. They are called “mixed tumours” because both \nepithelial and mesenchymal elements are seen in histol-\nogy.  The  stroma  of  the  tumour  may  be  mucoid,  fibroid,  \nvascular,  myxochondroid  or  chondroid  and  its  propor-\ntion to the epithelial element may vary.\nThough  tumour  is  encapsulated,  it  sends  pseudopods  \ninto  the  surrounding  gland  which  are  left  behind  if  the  \ntumour is simply shelled out. It is therefore essential that \nsurgical  excision  of  the  tumour  should  include  normal  \ngland  tissue  around  it.  In  the  parotid,  it  amounts  to  su-\nperficial parotidectomy.\nADENOLYMPHOMA (PAPILLARY \nCYSTADENOMA LYMPHOMATOSUM, \nWARTHIN TUMOUR)\nThey are commonly seen between fifth and seventh dec-\nade  with  preponderance  in  males  (5:1).  They  mostly  in-\nvolve  the  tail  of  the  parotid  and  are  bilateral  in  10%  of  \nthe  patients.  They  may  be  multiple.  Adenolymphoma  \nis a rounded, encapsulated tumour, at times cystic, with \nmucoid  or  brownish  fluid.  Histologically,  epithelial  and  \nlymphoid elements are seen. Treatment is superficial pa-\nrotidectomy though they can be enucleated without dan-\nger of recurrence.\nONCOCYTOMA (OXYPHIL ADENOMA)\nThey arise from acidophilic cells called oncocytes and com-\nprise  less  than  1%  of  all  salivary  gland  tumours.  Mostly  \nseen in the elderly, they usually do not grow larger than \n5 cm and involve the superficial lobe of parotid. Benign \noncocytomas are cystic rather than solid. Malignant on-\ncocytomas  are  also  seen.  Oncocytomas  show  increased  \nuptake of technetium-99.\nTreatment  for  parotid  oncocytomas  is  also  superficial  \nparotidectomy.\nHAEMANGIOMAS\nHaemangiomas are the most common benign tumours of \nthe parotid in children, predominantly affecting females. \nMost of them are discovered at birth, grow rapidly in the \nneonatal period and then involute spontaneously. Cuta-\nneous haemangioma may coexist in 50% of the patients. \nThey are soft and painless and increase in size with crying \nor  straining.  Overlying  skin  may  show  bluish  discolora-\ntion. Surgical excision is indicated if they do not regress \nspontaneously.\nLYMPHANGIOMAS\nThey  are  less  common  and  may  involve  parotid  and  \nsubmandibular  glands.

Facial nerve is preserved.\nHigh-grade tumours being more aggressive are treated \nby  total  parotidectomy.  Facial  nerve  may  be  sacrificed  \nif  invaded  by  the  tumour.  Some  surgeons  also  combine  \nradical neck dissection because of high incidence of mi-\ncroscopic spread of the tumour.\nADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA \n(CYLINDROMA)\nIt is a slow-growing tumour but infiltrates widely into the \ntissue planes and muscles. It also invades perineural spac-\nes and lymphatics and thus causes pain and VIIth nerve \nparalysis. It can metastasize to lymph nodes. Local recur-\nrences after surgical excision are common and can occur \nas late as 10–20 years after surgery. Distant metastases go \nto the lung, brain and bone.\nTreatment is radical parotidectomy with largest cuff of \ngrossly  normal  tissue  around  the  boundaries  of  the  tu-\nmour.  Radical  neck  is  not  done  unless  nodal  metastases  \nare present. Postoperative radiation is given if margins of \nthe resected specimen are not free of tumour.\nACINIC CELL CARCINOMA\nIt  is  a  low-grade  tumour  which  appears  similar  to  a  be-\nnign mixed tumour. It presents as a small, firm, movable \nand  encapsulated  tumour,  sometimes  bilateral.  Metasta-\nses are rare. A conservative approach of superficial or total \nparotidectomy is adopted.\nADENOCARCINOMA\nMore often it arises in minor salivary glands. It is highly \naggressive locally and sends distant metastasis.\nMALIGNANT MIXED TUMOUR\nThere are two varieties of this tumour:\n1.  Carcinoma  developing  in  pre-existing  benign  mixed  \ntumour and\n2. A“de novo” tumour.\nThe latter has much shorter history. Rapid growth and \npain developing in a benign tumour should always arouse \na suspicion of malignant change. Treatment of malignant \ntumour  is  radical  parotidectomy.  Facial  nerve  sacrificed  \nduring operation is grafted immediately.\nSQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (FIGURE 46.1)\nIt is a rapidly growing tumour that infiltrates, causes pain \nand ulcerates through the skin. It can metastasize to neck \nnodes. Treatment is radical parotidectomy which may in-\nclude cuff of muscle or even a portion of mandible, tempo-\nral bone and the involved skin.

Cover-\ning epithelium is of three types: ciliated pseudostratified \ncolumnar,  stratified  squamous  and  transitional.  Unlike  \npalatine tonsils, adenoids have no crypts and no capsule. \nAdenoid  tissue  is  present  at  birth,  shows  physiological  \nenlargement up to the age of 6 years, and then tends to \natrophy at puberty and almost completely disappears by \nthe age of 20 (Figure 48.2).\nIn  relation  to  sellaturcica,  three  types  of  pneuma-\ntization of sphenoid is seen: presellar, sellar and post-\nsellar.

Certain  children  have  a  tendency  to  generalized  \nlymphoid hyperplasia in which adenoids also take part.\nRecurrent attacks of rhinitis, sinusitis or chronic tonsil-\nlitis may cause chronic adenoid infection and hyperplasia.\nAllergy of the upper respiratory tract may also contrib-\nute to the enlargement of adenoids.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nSymptoms and signs depend not merely on the absolute \nsize of the adenoid mass but are relative to the available \nspace in the nasopharynx.\nEnlarged and infected adenoids may cause nasal, aural \nor general symptoms.\n1. Nasal Symptoms\n(a) Nasal  obstruction  is  the  commonest  symptom.  This  \nleads  to  mouth  breathing.  Nasal  obstruction  also  \ninterferes  with  feeding  or  suckling  in  a  child.  As  \nrespiration  and  feeding  cannot  take  place  simulta-\nneously,  a  child  with  adenoid  enlargement  fails  to  \nthrive.\n(b) Nasal  discharge.  It  is  partly  due  to  choanal  obstruc-\ntion, as the normal nasal secretions cannot drain into \nnasopharynx  and  partly  due  to  associated  chronic  \nrhinitis. The child often has a wet bubbly nose.\n(c) Sinusitis.  Chronic  maxillary  sinusitis  is  commonly  \nassociated  with  adenoids.  It  is  due  to  persistence  of  \nnasal discharge and infection. Reverse is also true that \na primary maxillary sinusitis may lead to infected and \nenlarged adenoids.\n(d) Epistaxis.   When   adenoids   are   acutely   inflamed,   \nepistaxis can occur with nose blowing.\n(e) Voice change. Voice is toneless and loses nasal quality \ndue to nasal obstruction.\n2. Aural Symptoms\n(a) Tubal obstruction. Adenoid mass blocks the eustachian \ntube  leading  to  retracted  tympanic  membrane  and  \nconductive hearing loss.\n(b) Recurrent attacks of acute otitis media may occur due to \nspread of infection via the eustachian tube.\n(c) Chronic  suppurative  otitis  media  may  fail  to  resolve  in  \nthe presence of infected adenoids.\n(d) Otitis  media  with  effusion.  Adenoids  form  an  impor-\ntant cause of otitis media with effusion in children. The \nwaxing and waning size of adenoids causes intermit-\ntent  eustachian  tube  obstruction  with  fluctuating  \nhearing loss. Impedance audiometry helps to identify \nthe condition.\n3. General Symptoms\n(a) Adenoid  facies.  Chronic  nasal  obstruction  and  mouth  \nbreathing lead to characteristic facial appearance called \nadenoid  facies.  The  child  has  an  elongated  face  with  \ndull  expression,  open  mouth,  prominent  and  crowd-\ned  upper  teeth  and  hitched  up  upper  lip.  Nose  gives  a  \npinched-in appearance due to disuse atrophy of alaenasi \n(Figure 48.3). Hard palate in these cases is highly arched \nas the moulding action of the tongue on palate is lost.\n(b) Pulmonary hypertension.

A strip of mucosa from fossa of Rosenmüller \nor posterior wall of nasopharynx can be taken. It may \nrequire transpalatal exposure of nasopharynx. General \nanaesthesia is preferred if occult primary is suspected.\n4. Audiogram. A baseline audiogram is important. It not \nonly establishes diagnosis of serous otitis media but is \nalso important for side effects of radiation and chemo-\ntherapy which can cause sensorineural hearing loss.\nClassification (see Table 49.4)\nWHO   classified   nasopharyngeal   carcinoma   on   histo-\npathological  basis  into  three  types  (Table  49.3).  Type  III  \nis  the  most  common  in  North  America.  However,  the  \nfrequency of different histopathological types may differ \nfrom country to country. These types have also been cor-\nrelated to titres of EB virus and also in their response to \nradiotherapy.  It  is  observed  that  type  II  and  type  III  are  \nassociated with higher titres of EB virus and have higher \nlocal control rates with radiotherapy.\nTreatment\n1. Radiotherapy.  It  is  the  treatment  of  choice  for  na-\nsopharyngeal  cancer.  Stage  I  and  II  are  treated  by  \nradiotherapy alone while stage III and IV require con-\ncomitant radiation and chemotherapy or radiation fol-\nlowed  by  chemotherapy.  External  beam  radiation  of  \n6000–7000 cGy can be delivered by linear accelerator \nto the primary and both sides of neck. More advanced \ntechniques of radiotherapy such as three-dimensional \nconformal radiotherapy and intensity modulated radi-\notherapy (IMRT) are now being used more and more. \nThey allow higher dose delivery to the tumour with re-\nduced damage to the adjacent normal structures such \nas spinal cord, brainstem and parotid glands. IMRT has \nalso been used for recurrent disease where convention-\nal radiotherapy produces more serious side effects such \nas transverse myelitis.\n2. Chemotherapy. Some stage III and IV cancers of naso-\npharynx can be cured by radiotherapy alone but cure \nrate is doubled when chemotherapy is combined with \nradiotherapy.  Chemotherapy  can  be  given  concomi-\ntantly or postradiotherapy. Cisplatin or cisplatin with \n5-FU  have  been  used.  Chemotherapy  has  also  been  \nfound  useful  to  control  metastases  from  lymphoepi-\nthelioma and undifferentiated carcinoma of nasophar-\nynx.

They require radical neck \ndissection  with  removal  of  sternocleidomastoid  \nmuscle, CN XI and internal jugular vein. Modified \nneck  dissection  is  not  preferred  as  extensive  dis-\nease has been seen on histopathology even when \nonly  a  single  node  was  present.  Bilateral  neck  \ndisease  may  require  bilateral  neck  dissection  but  \nwith preservation of internal jugular vein to avoid \ncerebral and facial oedema.\n(b) Recurrent  or  residual  (persistent)  disease  in  the  naso-\npharynx.

Nystatin is the drug of choice.\nMISCELLANEOUS CAUSES OF PHARYNGITIS\nChlamydia  trachomatis  infection  causes  acute  pharyngi-\ntis and can be treated by erythromycin or sulfonamides. \nToxoplasmosis is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate \nintracellular parasite. This infection is very rare.\nCHRONIC PHARYNGITIS\nIt  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  condition  of  the  pharynx.  \nPathologically,  it  is  characterized  by  hypertrophy  of  \nmucosa,  seromucinous  glands,  subepithelial  lymphoid  \nfollicles and even the muscular coat of the pharynx.\nChronic pharyngitis is of two types:\n1. Chronic catarrhal pharyngitis.\n2. Chronic hypertrophic (granular) pharyngitis.\nAETIOLOGY\nA large number of factors are responsible:\n1. Persistent infection in the neighbourhood. In chron-\nic rhinitis and sinusitis, purulent discharge constantly \ntrickles  down  the  pharynx  and  provides  a  constant  \nsource of infection. This causes hypertrophy of the lat-\neral pharyngeal bands.\n2. Mouth   breathing.   Breathing   through   the   mouth   \nexposes  the  pharynx  to  air  which  has  not  been  fil-\ntered,  humidified  and  adjusted  to  body  temperature  \nthus making it more susceptible to infections. Mouth \nbreathing is due to:\n(a) Obstruction in the nose, e.g. nasal polypi, allergic \nor vasomotor rhinitis, turbinal hypertrophy, devi-\nated septum or tumours.\n(b) Obstruction in the nasopharynx, e.g. adenoids and \ntumours.\n(c) Protruding teeth which prevent apposition of lips.\n(d) Habitual, without any organic cause.\n3. Chronic irritants. Excessive smoking, chewing of to-\nbacco and pan, heavy drinking or highly spiced food \ncan all lead to chronic pharyngitis.\n4. Environmental  pollution.  Smoky  or  dusty  environ-\nment or irritant industrial fumes may also be responsi-\nble for chronic pharyngitis.\n5. Faulty  voice  production.  Less  often  realized  but  an  \nimportant  cause  of  chronic  pharyngitis  is  the  faulty  \nvoice production. Excessive use of voice or faulty voice \nproduction  seen  in  certain  professionals  or  in  “phar-\nyngeal  neurosis”  where  person  resorts  to  constant  \nthroat  clearing,  hawking  or  snorting,  and  that  may  \ncause  chronic  pharyngitis,  especially  of  hypertrophic  \nvariety.\nSYMPTOMS\nSeverity of symptoms in chronic pharyngitis varies from \nperson to person.\n1. Discomfort  or  pain  in  the  throat.  This  is  especially  \nnoticed in the mornings.\n2. Foreign body sensation in throat. Patient has a con-\nstant desire to swallow or clear his throat to get rid of \nthis “foreign body.”\n3. Tiredness of voice. Patient cannot speak for long and \nhas to make undue effort to speak as throat starts ach-\ning. The voice may also lose its quality and may even \ncrack.\n4. Cough.  Throat  is  irritable  and  there  is  tendency  to  \ncough. Mere opening of the mouth may induce retch-\ning or gagging.\nSIGNS\n1. chronic  catarrhal  pharyngitis.  In  this,  there  is  \na congestion of posterior pharyngeal wall with engorge-\nment of vessels; faucial pillars may be thickened. There is \nincreased  mucus  secretion  which  may  cover  pharyngeal  \nmucosa.\n2. chronic hypertrophic (granular) pharyngitis\n(a)  Pharyngeal  wall  appears  thick  and  oedematous  with  \ncongested mucosa and dilated vessels.\n(b)   Posterior   pharyngeal   wall   may   be   studded   with   \nreddish   nodules   (hence   the   term   granular   phar-\nyngitis).

Nystatin is the drug of choice.\nMISCELLANEOUS CAUSES OF PHARYNGITIS\nChlamydia  trachomatis  infection  causes  acute  pharyngi-\ntis and can be treated by erythromycin or sulfonamides. \nToxoplasmosis is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate \nintracellular parasite. This infection is very rare.\nCHRONIC PHARYNGITIS\nIt  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  condition  of  the  pharynx.  \nPathologically,  it  is  characterized  by  hypertrophy  of  \nmucosa,  seromucinous  glands,  subepithelial  lymphoid  \nfollicles and even the muscular coat of the pharynx.\nChronic pharyngitis is of two types:\n1. Chronic catarrhal pharyngitis.\n2. Chronic hypertrophic (granular) pharyngitis.\nAETIOLOGY\nA large number of factors are responsible:\n1. Persistent infection in the neighbourhood.

        "AETIOLOGY\nA large number of factors are responsible:\n1. Persistent infection in the neighbourhood. In chron-\nic rhinitis and sinusitis, purulent discharge constantly \ntrickles  down  the  pharynx  and  provides  a  constant  \nsource of infection. This causes hypertrophy of the lat-\neral pharyngeal bands.\n2. Mouth   breathing.   Breathing   through   the   mouth   \nexposes  the  pharynx  to  air  which  has  not  been  fil-\ntered,  humidified  and  adjusted  to  body  temperature  \nthus making it more susceptible to infections. Mouth \nbreathing is due to:\n(a) Obstruction in the nose, e.g. nasal polypi, allergic \nor vasomotor rhinitis, turbinal hypertrophy, devi-\nated septum or tumours.\n(b) Obstruction in the nasopharynx, e.g. adenoids and \ntumours.\n(c) Protruding teeth which prevent apposition of lips.\n(d) Habitual, without any organic cause.\n3. Chronic irritants. Excessive smoking, chewing of to-\nbacco and pan, heavy drinking or highly spiced food \ncan all lead to chronic pharyngitis.",
        "(d) Habitual, without any organic cause.\n3. Chronic irritants. Excessive smoking, chewing of to-\nbacco and pan, heavy drinking or highly spiced food \ncan all lead to chronic pharyngitis.\n4. Environmental  pollution.  Smoky  or  dusty  environ-\nment or irritant industrial fumes may also be responsi-\nble for chronic pharyngitis.\n5. Faulty  voice  production.  Less  often  realized  but  an  \nimportant  cause  of  chronic  pharyngitis  is  the  faulty  \nvoice production. Excessive use of voice or faulty voice \nproduction  seen  in  certain  professionals  or  in  “phar-\nyngeal  neurosis”  where  person  resorts  to  constant  \nthroat  clearing,  hawking  or  snorting,  and  that  may  \ncause  chronic  pharyngitis,  especially  of  hypertrophic  \nvariety.\nSYMPTOMS\nSeverity of symptoms in chronic pharyngitis varies from \nperson to person.\n1.

Patient has a con-\nstant desire to swallow or clear his throat to get rid of \nthis “foreign body.”\n3. Tiredness of voice. Patient cannot speak for long and \nhas to make undue effort to speak as throat starts ach-\ning. The voice may also lose its quality and may even \ncrack.\n4. Cough.  Throat  is  irritable  and  there  is  tendency  to  \ncough. Mere opening of the mouth may induce retch-\ning or gagging.\nSIGNS\n1. chronic  catarrhal  pharyngitis.  In  this,  there  is  \na congestion of posterior pharyngeal wall with engorge-\nment of vessels; faucial pillars may be thickened. There is \nincreased  mucus  secretion  which  may  cover  pharyngeal  \nmucosa.\n2. chronic hypertrophic (granular) pharyngitis\n(a)  Pharyngeal  wall  appears  thick  and  oedematous  with  \ncongested mucosa and dilated vessels.",

Trauma  to  the  tonsil  area  \nmay occur accidently when hit with a toothbrush, a pen-\ncil  held  in  mouth  or  fingering  in  the  throat.  Membrane  \nappears within 24 h.\n10. Candidal infection of tonsil\nDiagnosis of ulceromembranous lesion of throat thus \nrequires:\n1.  History.\n2. Physical examination.\n3. Total and differential counts (for agranulocytosis, leu-\nkaemia, neutropenia, infectious mononucleosis).\n4. Blood smear (for atypical cells).\n5.   Throat   swab   and   culture   (for   pyogenic   bacteria,   \n Vincent angina, diphtheria and Candida infection).\n6. Bone marrow aspiration or needle biopsy.\n7. Other tests. Paul–Bunnell or mono spot test and biopsy \nof the lesion.\nFAUCIAL DIPHTHERIA\nAETIOLOGY\nIt is an acute specific infection caused by the Gram-pos-\nitive  bacillus,  C.  diphtheriae.  It  spreads  by  droplet  infec-\ntion.  Incubation  period  is  2–6  days.  Some  persons  are  \n“carriers”  of  this  disease,  i.e.  they  harbour  organisms  in  \ntheir throat but have no symptoms.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nChildren  are  affected  more  often  though  no  age  group  \nis  immune.  Oropharynx  is  commonly  involved  and  the  \nlarynx and nasal cavity may also be affected.\nIn  the  oropharynx,  a  greyish  white  membrane  forms  \nover  the  tonsils  and  spreads  to  the  soft  palate  and  pos-\nterior  pharyngeal  wall.  It  is  quite  tenacious  and  causes  \nbleeding  when  removed.  Cervical  lymph  nodes,  partic-\nularly  the  jugulodigastric,  become  enlarged  and  tender,  \nsometimes  presenting  a  “bull-neck”  appearance.  Patient  \nis ill and toxaemic but fever seldom rises above 38 °C.\nCOMPLICATIONS\nExotoxin produced by C. diphtheriae is toxic to the heart \nand nerves. It causes myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmias and \nacute circulatory failure.\nNeurological complications usually appear a few weeks \nafter  infection  and  include  paralysis  of  soft  palate, dia-\nphragm and ocular muscles.\nIn  the  larynx,  diphtheritic  membrane  may  cause  air-\nway obstruction.\nTREATMENT\nTreatment  of  diphtheria  is  started  on  clinical  suspicion  \nwithout waiting for the culture report. Aim is to neutral-\nize the free exotoxin still circulating in the blood and to \nkill the organisms producing this exotoxin. Dose of anti-\ntoxin is based on the site involved and the duration and \nseverity of disease. It is 20,000–40,000 units for diphthe-\nria in less than 48 h, or when the membrane is confined \nto the tonsils only; and 80,000–120,000 units, if disease \nhas  lasted  longer  than  48  h,  or  the  membrane  is  more  \nextensive. Antitoxin is given by i.v. infusion in saline in \nabout 60 min. Sensitivity to horse serum should be tested \nby conjunctival or intracutaneous test with diluted anti-\ntoxin and adrenaline should be at hand for any immedi-\nate  hypersensitivity.  In  the  presence  of  hypersensitivity  \nreaction, desensitization should be done.\nAntibiotics used are benzyl penicillin 600 mg 6 hourly \nfor 7 days.

        "CLINICAL FEATURES\nChildren  are  affected  more  often  though  no  age  group  \nis  immune.  Oropharynx  is  commonly  involved  and  the  \nlarynx and nasal cavity may also be affected.\nIn  the  oropharynx,  a  greyish  white  membrane  forms  \nover  the  tonsils  and  spreads  to  the  soft  palate  and  pos-\nterior  pharyngeal  wall.  It  is  quite  tenacious  and  causes  \nbleeding  when  removed.  Cervical  lymph  nodes,  partic-\nularly  the  jugulodigastric,  become  enlarged  and  tender,  \nsometimes  presenting  a  “bull-neck”  appearance.  Patient  \nis ill and toxaemic but fever seldom rises above 38 °C.\nCOMPLICATIONS\nExotoxin produced by C. diphtheriae is toxic to the heart \nand nerves. It causes myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmias and \nacute circulatory failure.\nNeurological complications usually appear a few weeks \nafter  infection  and  include  paralysis  of  soft  palate, dia-\nphragm and ocular muscles.\nIn  the  larynx,  diphtheritic  membrane  may  cause  air-",
        "after  infection  and  include  paralysis  of  soft  palate, dia-\nphragm and ocular muscles.\nIn  the  larynx,  diphtheritic  membrane  may  cause  air-\nway obstruction.\nTREATMENT\nTreatment  of  diphtheria  is  started  on  clinical  suspicion  \nwithout waiting for the culture report. Aim is to neutral-\nize the free exotoxin still circulating in the blood and to \nkill the organisms producing this exotoxin. Dose of anti-\ntoxin is based on the site involved and the duration and \nseverity of disease. It is 20,000–40,000 units for diphthe-\nria in less than 48 h, or when the membrane is confined \nto the tonsils only; and 80,000–120,000 units, if disease \nhas  lasted  longer  than  48  h,  or  the  membrane  is  more  \nextensive. Antitoxin is given by i.v. infusion in saline in \nabout 60 min.

Sensitivity to horse serum should be tested \nby conjunctival or intracutaneous test with diluted anti-\ntoxin and adrenaline should be at hand for any immedi-\nate  hypersensitivity.  In  the  presence  of  hypersensitivity  \nreaction, desensitization should be done.\nAntibiotics used are benzyl penicillin 600 mg 6 hourly \nfor 7 days.

Deep cervical fascia \nsplits into two layers, superficial and deep, to enclose the \nparotid gland and its associated structures. Parotid space \nlies deep to its superficial layer.\nContents  of  parotid  space  include  parotid  gland  and  \nits  associated  parotid  lymph  nodes,  facial  nerve,  external  \ncarotid artery and retromandibular vein. Fascial layer is very \nthick superficially but very thin on the deep side of the pa-\nrotid gland where parotid abscess can burst to form a para-\npharyngeal abscess and thence spread to the mediastinum.\nAETIOLOGY\nDehydration, particularly in postsurgical cases and debili-\ntated patients, with stasis of salivary flow is the predispos-\ning  cause.  Infection  from  the  oral  cavity  travels  via  the  \nStenson’s duct to invade the parotid gland. Multiple small \nabscesses  may  form  in  the  parenchyma.  They  may  then  \ncoalesce to form a single abscess.\nBACTERIOLOGY\nMost common organism is Staphylococcus aureus but Strep-\ntococci, anaerobic organisms and rarely the Gram- negative \norganisms have been cultured.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nUsually  follows  5–7  days  after  operation.  There  is  swell-\ning,  redness,  indurations  and  tenderness  in  the  parotid  \narea and at the angle of mandible.\nParotid  abscess  is  usually  unilateral,  but  bilateral  ab-\nscesses may occur. Fluctuation is difficult to elicit due to \nthick  capsule.  Opening  of  the  Stenson’s  duct  becomes  \ncongested and may exude pus on pressure over the parot-\nid. Patient is toxic, running high fever and dehydrated.\nDIAGNOSIS\nDiagnosis  of  the  abscess  can  be  made  by  ultrasound  or  \ncomputed tomography scan. More than one loculi of pus \nmay be seen. Aspiration of abscess can be done for culture \nand sensitivity of the causative organisms.\nTREATMENT\nCorrect the dehydration, improve oral hygiene and pro-\nmote salivary flow. Intravenous antibiotics are instituted.\nSurgical  drainage  under  local  or  general  anaesthesia  \nis carried out by a preauricular incision as employed for \nparotidectomy. Skin flap is raised to expose surface of the \ngland,  and  the  abscess  or  abscesses  are  bluntly  opened  \nworking parallel to the branches of the VIIth nerve. Skin \nincision is loosely approximated over a drain and allowed \nto heal by secondary intention.\nLUDWIG’S ANGINA\nAPPLIED ANATOMY\nSubmandibular space lies between mucous membrane of \nthe floor of mouth and tongue on one side and superficial \nlayer of deep cervical fascia extending between the hyoid \nbone  and  mandible  on  the  other  (Figure  52.1).  It  is  di-\nvided into two compartments by the mylohyoid muscle:\n1. Sublingual compartment (above the mylohyoid).\n2. Submaxillary and submental compartment (below the \nmylohyoid).\nThe  two  compartments  are  continuous  around  the  \nposterior border of mylohyoid muscle.\nLudwig’s angina is infection of submandibular space.\nAETIOLOGY\n1. dental  inFections.  They  account  for  80%  of  the  \ncases. Roots of premolars often lie above the attachment \nof mylohyoid and cause sublingual space infection while \nroots of the molar teeth extend up to or below the mylo-\nhyoid line and primarily cause submaxillary space infec-\ntion (Figure 52.2).\n2. submandibular  sialadenitis,  injuries oF  oral \nmucosa and Fractures oF the mandible account for \nother cases.\nBACTERIOLOGY\nMixed infections involving both aerobes and anaerobes are \ncommon.  Alpha-haemolytic  Streptococci,  Staphylococci  \nand  bacteroides  groups  are  common.  Rarely  Haemophilus \ninfluenzae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas are seen.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nThere  is  marked  difficulty  in  swallowing  (odynophagia)  \nwith varying degrees of trismus.\nWhen  infection  is  localized  to  the  sublingual  space,  \nstructures in the floor of mouth are swollen and tongue \nseems to be pushed up and back.\nWhen  infection  spreads  to  submaxillary  space,  sub-\nmental and submandibular regions become swollen and \nmebooksfree.com",

Fascial layer is very \nthick superficially but very thin on the deep side of the pa-\nrotid gland where parotid abscess can burst to form a para-\npharyngeal abscess and thence spread to the mediastinum.\nAETIOLOGY\nDehydration, particularly in postsurgical cases and debili-\ntated patients, with stasis of salivary flow is the predispos-\ning  cause.

They  may  then  \ncoalesce to form a single abscess.\nBACTERIOLOGY\nMost common organism is Staphylococcus aureus but Strep-\ntococci, anaerobic organisms and rarely the Gram- negative \norganisms have been cultured.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nUsually  follows  5–7  days  after  operation.  There  is  swell-\ning,  redness,  indurations  and  tenderness  in  the  parotid  \narea and at the angle of mandible.\nParotid  abscess  is  usually  unilateral,  but  bilateral  ab-\nscesses may occur. Fluctuation is difficult to elicit due to \nthick  capsule.  Opening  of  the  Stenson’s  duct  becomes  \ncongested and may exude pus on pressure over the parot-\nid.

Patient is toxic, running high fever and dehydrated.\nDIAGNOSIS\nDiagnosis  of  the  abscess  can  be  made  by  ultrasound  or  \ncomputed tomography scan. More than one loculi of pus \nmay be seen. Aspiration of abscess can be done for culture \nand sensitivity of the causative organisms.\nTREATMENT\nCorrect the dehydration, improve oral hygiene and pro-\nmote salivary flow. Intravenous antibiotics are instituted.\nSurgical  drainage  under  local  or  general  anaesthesia  \nis carried out by a preauricular incision as employed for \nparotidectomy. Skin flap is raised to expose surface of the \ngland,  and  the  abscess  or  abscesses  are  bluntly  opened  \nworking parallel to the branches of the VIIth nerve.

This  is  usu-\nally  done  without  anaesthesia  as  there  is  risk  of  rupture  \nof  abscess  during  intubation.  Child  is  kept  supine  with  \nhead low. Mouth is opened with a gag. A vertical incision \nis  given  in  the  most  fluctuant  area  of  the  abscess.  Suc-\ntion  should  always  be  available  to  prevent  aspiration  of  \npus. If done under GA, care should be taken that the ab-\nscess does not rupture during intubation with aspiration \nof pus. The pharynx is always packed. Aspiration for an \nabscess can be done before incision to break the pressure \nin the abscess and gush of pus.\nFigure 52.6. Spaces in relation to pharynx where abscesses can form.\nFigure  52.7.

Obese patients need to reduce weight.\n2. Collar  size.  Neck  circumference  at  the  level  of  crico-\nthyroid membrane is measured. Collar size should not \nexceed 42 cm in males and 37.5 cm in females.\n3. Complete head and neck examination. Look for ton-\nsillar hypertrophy, retrognathia, macroglossia, elongated \nsoft palate and uvula, base of tongue tumours, septal de-\nviation,  nasal  polyps,  turbinate  hypertrophy  and  nasal  \nvalve collapse. Also examine nasopharynx and larynx.\n4. Muller’s  manoeuvre.  A  flexible  endoscope  is  passed  \nthrough the nose and the patient asked to inspire vig-\norously with nose and mouth completely closed. Look \nfor  collapse  of  the  soft  tissues  at  the  level  of  base  of  \ntongue and just above the soft palate.

In this study, the first \npart of night is used in usual polysomnography while the \nsecond  part  of  night  is  used  in  titration  of  pressures  for  \ncontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). It is not rec-\nommended because episodes of sleep apnoea occur more \noften  in  the  second  half  of  night  and  are  thus  missed.  \nTitration of pressures for CPAP should ideally be done on \na second night.\nPolysomnography  can  differentiate  between  primary  \nsnoring, pure OSA and central sleep apnoea.\nTreatment (Nonsurgical)\n1. Change in lifestyle. Those with mild disease and min-\nimal  symptoms  can  be  treated  with  weight  loss  and  \n dietary changes but those with cor pulmonale as a re-\nsult of severe OSA may require surgery.\n(a) Use of alcohol in the evening aggravates OSA. Sed-\natives/hypnotics taken at night also have the same \neffect.\n(b) Smoking should be avoided.\n(c) Reduction of weight is helpful.\n2. Positional  therapy.  Patient  should  sleep  on  the  side,  \nas  supine  position  may  cause  obstructive  apnoea.  A  \nrubber ball can be fixed to the back of shirt to prevent \nadopting supine position.\n3. Intraoral  devices.  They  alter  the  position  of  man-\ndible  or  tongue  to  open  the  retropalatal  airway  and  \nrelieve  snoring  and  sleep  apnoea.  Mandible  advance-\nment device (MAD) keeps the mandible forward while \ntongue-retaining device (TRD) keeps tongue in anteri-\nor position during sleep. They help improve or abolish \nsnoring. MAD is also useful in retrognathic patients.\n4. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). It pro-\nvides pneumatic splint to airway and increases its cali-\nbre. Optimum airway pressure for device to open the \nairway is determined during sleep study and is usually \nkept at 5–20 cm H\n2\nO. About 40% of patients find the \nuse of CPAP device cumbersome and difficult to carry \nwith them when travelling and thus stop using it.\nWhen CPAP is not tolerated, a BiPAP (bilevel positive \nairway  pressure)  device  is  used.  It  delivers  positive  pres-\nsure at two fixed levels—a higher inspiratory and a lower \nexpiratory  pressure.

Septoplasty  to  \ncorrect  deviated  nasal  septum,  removal  of  nasal  polyps  \nand  reduction  of  turbinate  size  help  to  relieve  nasal  ob-\nstruction.  Sometimes  nasal  surgery  is  also  indicated  for  \nefficient use of CPAP.\n2. Oropharyngeal surgery. Uvulopalatoplasty (UPP) is \nthe most common procedure performed for snoring and \nOSA.  It  is  80%  effective  in  snoring  but  OSA  is  relieved  \nonly in 50%. Some patients of OSA are known to relapse \nin long-term studies because of another site becoming ac-\ntive in the cause of obstruction (e.g. base of tongue). UPP \ncan be laser or radiofrequency assisted.\n3.  Tonsillectomy  and/or  adenoidectomy.  Surgical  \ntreatment is tailored to the level of obstruction:\n(a) Nose and nasopharynx (level I).\n(b) Soft palate and tonsils (level II).\n(c) Tongue base and pharynx (level III).\nSometimes more than one level is involved.\n4.

It moves vertically and in \nanteroposterior direction during swallowing and phona-\ntion. It can also be passively moved from side to side pro-\nducing  a  characteristic  grating  sensation  called  laryngeal \ncrepitus. In an adult, the larynx ends at the lower border \nof C\n6\n vertebra.\nLARYNGEAL CARTILAGES\nLarynx has three unpaired and three paired cartilages.\nUnpaired: Thyroid, cricoid and epiglottis.\nPaired: Arytenoid, corniculate and cuneiform.\n1. Thyroid.  It  is  the  largest  of  all  (Figure  56.1).  Its  two  \nalae meet anteriorly forming an angle of 90° in males \nand  120°  in  females.  Vocal  cords  are  attached  to  the  \nmiddle  of  thyroid  angle.  Most  of  laryngeal  foreign  \nbodies are arrested above the vocal cords, i.e. above the \nmiddle of thyroid cartilage and an effective airway can \nbe provided by piercing the cricothyroid membrane—\na procedure called cricothyrotomy.\n2. Cricoid.  It  is  the  only  cartilage  forming  a  complete  \nring.  Its  posterior  part  is  expanded  to  form  a  lamina \nwhile anteriorly it is narrow forming an arch.\n3. Epiglottis. It is a leaf-like, yellow, elastic cartilage form-\ning anterior wall of laryngeal inlet. It is attached to the \nbody of hyoid bone by hyoepiglottic ligament, which \ndivides it into suprahyoid and infrahyoid epiglottis. A \nstalk-like process of epiglottis (petiole) attaches the ep-\niglottis to the thyroid angle just above the attachment \nof  vocal  cords.  Anterior  surface  of  epiglottis  is  sepa-\nrated  from  thyrohyoid  membrane  and  upper  part  of  \nthyroid cartilage by a potential space filled with fat—\nthe pre-epiglottic space. The space may be invaded in \ncarcinoma of supraglottic larynx or the base of tongue.\nPosterior  surface  of  epiglottis  is  concavoconvex—\nconcave above but convex below forming a bulge called \ntubercle  of  epiglottis,  which  obstructs  view  of  anterior  \ncommissure when examining larynx by indirect laryn-\ngoscopy.  Epiglottic  cartilage  shows  several  pits  which  \nlodge the mucous glands. It may also show perforations \nproviding direct communication between the laryngeal \nsurface of epiglottis and pre-epiglottic space. Supraglot-\ntic  cancers  can  spread  through  them  to  pre-epiglottic  \nspace. Epiglottis is not essential for swallowing and can \nbe amputated in carcinoma with little aspiration.\n4. Arytenoid cartilages. They are paired. Each arytenoid \ncartilage  is  pyramidal  in  shape.  It  has  a  base  which  \narticulates  with  cricoid  cartilage;  a  muscular  process, \ndirected laterally to give attachment to intrinsic laryn-\ngeal muscles; a vocal process directed anteriorly, giving \nattachment to vocal cord; and an apex which supports \nthe corniculate cartilage.\n5. Corniculate cartilages (of Santorini) (Corn = horn). \nThey are paired. Each articulates with the apex of aryt-\nenoid cartilage as if forming its horn.\n6. Cuneiform  cartilages  (of  Wrisberg).

Infant’s larynx is positioned high in the neck level of \nglottis being opposite to C3 or C4 at rest and reaches C1 \nor C2 during swallowing. This high position allows the \nepiglottis to meet soft palate and make a nasopharyn-\ngeal channel for nasal breathing during suckling. The \nmilk feed passes separately over the dorsum of tongue \nand the sides of epiglottis, thus allowing breathing and \nfeeding to go on simultaneously.\n2.   Laryngeal   cartilages   are   soft   and   collapse   easily.   \n  Epiglottis  is  omega  shaped  and  arytenoids  relatively  \nlarge  covering  significant  portion  of  the  posterior  \nglottis.\n3.  Thyroid  cartilage  in  an  infant  is  flat.  It  also  overlaps  \nthe  cricoid  cartilage  and  is  in  turn  overlapped  by  the  \nhyoid bone. Thus cricothyroid and thyrohyoid spaces \nare  narrow  and  not  easily  discernible  as  landmarks  \nwhen performing tracheostomy.\n4. Infant’s larynx is small and conical. The diameter of cri-\ncoid cartilage is smaller than the size of glottis, making \nsubglottis  the  narrowest  part.  It  has  a  bearing  in  the  \nselection of paediatric endotracheal tube.\n  In  adults,  subglottic-glottic  dimensions  are  approxi-\nmately same and larynx is cylindrical.\n5. Submucosal tissues of infant’s larynx are comparative-\nly  loose  and  easily  undergo  oedematous  change  with  \ntrauma or inflammation leading to obstruction.\nInfant’s larynx shows two spurts in growth. In the first \n3  years  of  life,  larynx  grows  in  width  and  length,  and  \nthus obviates the need for any airway surgery in certain \ncongenital anomalies. The second spurt in growth occurs \nduring  adolescence  when  the  thyroid  angle  develops.  \nThe length of vocal cords then increases leading to voice \nchanges associated with puberty (see puberphonia). With \ngrowth  of  the  neck,  larynx  gradually  descends  to  adult  \nlevel; the vocal cords lying opposite C\n5\n.\nIn childhood, vocal cord is 6 mm in females and 8 mm \nin  males.  It  increases  to  15–19  mm  in  adult  female  and  \n17–23 in adult male.\nPHYSIOLOGY OF LARYNX\nThe larynx performs the following important functions:\n1. Protection of lower airways\n2.  Phonation\n3.  Respiration\n4. Fixation of the chest.\nA. PROTECTION OF LOWER AIRWAYS\nPhylogenetically, protection of lower airways is the earli-\nest  function  to  develop;  voice  production  is  secondary.  \nThe larynx protects the lower passages in three different \nways:\n1. Sphincteric closure of laryngeal opening.\n2. Cessation of respiration.\n3. Cough reflex.\nWhen  food  is  swallowed,  its  entry  into  air  passage  is  \nprevented  by  closure  of  three  successive  sphincters  con-\nsisting  of  (i)  laryngeal  inlet  (aryepiglottic  folds,  tubercle  \nof epiglottis and arytenoids, approximate thus closing the \nlaryngeal  inlet  completely),  (ii)  false  cords  and  (iii)  true  \ncords,  which  close  the  glottis.  Thus,  no  foreign  matter  \nmeant to be swallowed or accidentally vomited can enter \nthe larynx.\nRespiration temporarily ceases through a reflex gener-\nated by afferent fibres of ninth nerve, when food comes \nin contact with posterior pharyngeal wall or the base of \ntongue.\nCough  is  an  important  and  powerful  mechanism  to  \ndislodge and expel a foreign particle when it comes into \ncontact  with  respiratory  mucosa.  Larynx  is  aptly  called  \nwatch-dog of lungs as it immediately “barks” at the entry \nof any foreign intruder.\nB. PHONATION\nLarynx  is  like  a  wind  instrument.  Voice  is  produced  by  \nthe  following  mechanism  (aerodynamic  myoelastic  theory  \nof voice production):\n1. Vocal cords are kept adducted.\n2. Infraglottic air pressure is generated by the exhaled air \nfrom the lungs due to contraction of thoracic and ab-\ndominal muscles.\n3.  The  air  force  open  the  cords  and  is  released  as  small  \npuffs which vibrate the vocal cords and produce sound \nwhich is amplified by mouth, pharynx, nose and chest.\nThis sound is converted into speech by the modulatory \naction of lips, tongue, palate, pharynx and teeth.\nIntensity  of  sound  depends  on  the  air  pressure  pro-\nduced by the lungs while pitch depends on the frequency \nwith which the vocal cords vibrate.\nC. RESPIRATION\nLarynx  regulates  flow  of  air  into  the  lungs.  Vocal  cords  \nabduct during inspiration and adduct during expiration.\nD. FIXATION OF THE CHEST\nWhen larynx is closed, chest wall gets fixed and various \nthoracic  and  abdominal  muscles  can  then  act  best.  This  \nfunction  is  important  in  digging,  pulling  and  climbing.  \nCoughing, vomiting, defaecation, micturition and child-\nbirth  also  require  a  fixed  thoracic  cage  against  a  closed  \nglottis.\nmebooksfree.com",

        "Chapter 56 — Anatomy and Physiology of Larynx\n323\nPAEDIATRIC LARYNX\nThe larynx of an infant differs considerably from that of \nan adult and has a great clinical significance.\n1. Infant’s larynx is positioned high in the neck level of \nglottis being opposite to C3 or C4 at rest and reaches C1 \nor C2 during swallowing. This high position allows the \nepiglottis to meet soft palate and make a nasopharyn-\ngeal channel for nasal breathing during suckling. The \nmilk feed passes separately over the dorsum of tongue \nand the sides of epiglottis, thus allowing breathing and \nfeeding to go on simultaneously.\n2.   Laryngeal   cartilages   are   soft   and   collapse   easily.   \n  Epiglottis  is  omega  shaped  and  arytenoids  relatively  \nlarge  covering  significant  portion  of  the  posterior  \nglottis.\n3.

Exotoxin  liberated  by  bacteria  leading  to  myocarditis  \nand various neurological complications.\nCLINICAL FEATURES\n•\tGeneral symptoms. Onset is insidious with low-grade \nfever (100–101 °F), sore throat and malaise but patient \nis very toxaemic with tachycardia and thready pulse.\n•\tLaryngeal  symptoms.  Hoarse  voice,  croupy  cough,  \ninspiratory  stridor,  increasing  dyspnoea  with  marked  \nupper airway obstruction.\n•\tMembrane.  Greyish  white  membrane  is  seen  on  the  \ntonsil,  pharynx  and  soft  palate.  It  is  adherent  and  its  \nremoval leaves a bleeding surface. Similar membrane is \nseen over the larynx and trachea.\n•\tCervical   lymphadenopathy.   Characteristic   “bull-\nneck” may be seen.\nDIAGNOSIS\nLaryngeal diphtheria is mostly secondary to faucial diph-\ntheria.  Diagnosis  is  always  clinical  but  confirmed  by  \nsmear  and  culture  of  Corynebacterium  diphtheriae.  Treat-\nment is started on clinical suspicion.\nTREATMENT\n1. Diphtheria antitoxin. Dose depends on clinical sever-\nity and duration of illness, and varies from 20,000 to \n100,000  units  i.v.  route  as  saline  infusion  after  a  test  \ndose. It neutralizes free toxin circulating in the blood.\n2. Antibacterials.  Benzylpenicillin,  500,000  units  i.m.  \nevery 6 h for 6 days, is effective against diphtheria ba-\ncilli.  Erythromycin  can  be  given  to  those  who  are  al-\nlergic to penicillin.\n3. Maintenance  of  airway.  Tracheostomy  may  become  \nessential. Direct laryngoscopy, removal of diphtheritic \nmembrane  and  intubation  can  be  done.  Intubation  \nrelieves  respiratory  obstruction  and  can  make  subse-\nquent tracheostomy easy.\n4. Complete bed rest. Complete bed rest for 2–4 weeks is \nessential to guard against effects of myocarditis.\nCOMPLICATIONS\n1. Asphyxia and death due to airway obstruction.\n2.

It  is  mostly  seen  in  men  who  indulge  in  ex-\ncessive alcohol and smoking. Other factors are excessive \nforceful  talking  and  gastro-oesophageal  reflux  disease  \nwhere posterior part of larynx is being constantly bathed \nwith acid juices from the stomach.\nTreatment is removal of granulation tissue under oper-\nating  microscope  which  may  require  repetition,  control  \nof acid reflux and speech therapy.\nATROPHIC LARYNGITIS \n(LARYNGITIS SICCA)\nIt  is  characterized  by  atrophy  of  laryngeal  mucosa  and  \ncrust formation. Condition is often seen in women and is \nassociated with atrophic rhinitis and pharyngitis.\nCommon   symptoms   include   hoarseness   of   voice   \nwhich  temporarily  improves  on  coughing  and  removal  \nof crusts. Dry irritating cough and sometimes dyspnoea is \ndue to obstructing crusts.\nExamination  shows  atrophic  mucosa  covered  with  \nfoul-smelling  crusts.  When  crusts  have  been  expelled,  \nmucosa  may  show  excoriation  and  bleeding.  Crusting  \nmay also be seen in the trachea.\nTreatment  is  elimination  of  the  causative  factor  and  \nhumidification.  Laryngeal  sprays  with  glucose  in  glycer-\nine or oil of pine are comforting and help to loosen the \ncrusts.  Associated  nasal  and  pharyngeal  conditions  will  \nrequire  attention.  Expectorants  containing  ammonium  \nchloride or iodides also help to loosen the crusts.\nTUBERCULOSIS OF LARYNX\nAETIOLOGY\nIt  is  almost  always  secondary  to  pulmonary  tuberculosis,  \nmostly affecting males in middle age group. Tubercle bacilli \nreach the larynx by bronchogenic or haematogenous routes.\nPATHOLOGY\nDisease  affects  posterior  part  of  larynx  more  than  ante-\nrior.  Parts  affected  are:  (i)  interarytenoid  fold,  (ii)  ven-\ntricular bands, (iii) vocal cords and (iv) epiglottis, in that \norder.\nTubercle  bacilli,  carried  by  sputum  from  the  bronchi,  \nsettle and penetrate the intact laryngeal mucosa particu-\nlarly in the interarytenoid region (bronchogenic spread). \nThis  leads  to  formation  of  submucosal  tubercles  which  \nmay later caseate and ulcerate. Laryngeal mucosa appears \nred  and  swollen  due  to  cellular  infiltration  (pseudoede-\nma).  Stages  of  perichondritis  and  cartilage  necrosis  are  \nnot commonly seen these days.\nSYMPTOMS AND SIGNS\nThey would greatly depend on the stage of tuberculosis. \nWeakness  of  voice  is  the  earliest  symptom  followed  by  \nhoarseness.  Ulceration  in  the  larynx  gives  rise  to  severe  \npain which may radiate to the ears. Swallowing is painful \nwith marked dysphagia in later stages.\nLARYNGEAL EXAMINATION\n1.  Hyperaemia  of  the  vocal  cord  in  its  whole  extent  or  \nconfined to posterior part with impairment of adduc-\ntion is the first sign.\n2.

UNILATERAL\nThis causes paralysis of all the muscles of larynx on one \nside except the interarytenoid which also receives inner-\nvation from the opposite side.\nAetiology\nThyroid  surgery  is  the  most  common  cause  when  both  \nrecurrent and external laryngeal nerves of one side may \nbe involved.\nIt  may  also  occur  in  lesions  of  nucleus  ambiguus  or  \nthat of the vagus nerve proximal to the origin of superior \nlaryngeal nerve. Thus, lesion may lie in the medulla, pos-\nterior  cranial  fossa,  jugular  foramen  or  parapharyngeal  \nspace (Table 60.1).\nClinical Features\nAs  all  the  muscles  of  larynx  on  one  side  are  paralyzed,  \nvocal cord will lie in the cadaveric position, i.e. 3.5 mm \nfrom the midline (Table 60.2). The healthy cord is unable \nto  approximate  the  paralyzed  cord,  thus  causing  glottic  \nincompetence. This results in hoarseness of voice and as-\npiration of liquids through the glottis. Cough is ineffec-\ntive due to air waste.\nTreatment\n1. Speech  therapy.  With  proper  speech  therapy,  the  \nhealthy cord may compensate the loss of function of \nparalyzed vocal cord by moving across the midline.\n2. Procedures  to  medialize  the  cord.  In  uncompensat-\ned  cases,  aim  is  to  bring  the  paralyzed  cord  towards  \nthe  midline  so  that  healthy  cord  can  meet  it.  This  is  \nachieved by:\n(a) Injection of teflon paste lateral to the paralyzed cord. \nThis  is  done  by  direct  laryngoscopy  under    local  \n   anaesthesia.   Now   thyroplasty   is   the   preferred   \n procedure.\n(b) Thyroplasty type I. Vocal cord is medialized towards \nmidline  for  opposite  cord  to  meet.  This  can  be  \ncombined  with  arytenoids  adduction  procedure.  \nThyroplasty  is  done  by  creating  a  window  in  the  \nthyroid  cartilage  and  placing  a  silicon  or  other  \nprosthesis to medialize the cord. Operation can be \ndone under local anaesthesia.\nB.  BILATERAL\nBoth  recurrent  and  superior  laryngeal  nerves  on  both  \nsides  are  paralyzed.  This  is  a  rare  condition.  As  all  the  \nlaryngeal  muscles  are  paralyzed,  both  cords  lie  in  ca-\ndaveric  position.  There  is  also  total  anaesthesia  of  the  \nlarynx.\nClinical Features\n1. Aphonia. As cords do not meet at all.\n2. Aspiration. This is due to incompetent glottis and la-\nryngeal anaesthesia.\n3. Inability to cough. This is due to inability of the cords \nto  meet.  This  results  in  retention  of  secretions  in  the  \nchest.\n4. Bronchopneumonia.  This  is  due  to  repeated  aspira-\ntions and retention of secretions.\nTreatment\n1. Tracheostomy. Essential to remove pulmonary secre-\ntions and inhaled material.\n2. Gastrostomy. It will prevent aspiration and maintain \nnutrition.\n3. Epiglottopexy.

UNILATERAL\nThis causes paralysis of all the muscles of larynx on one \nside except the interarytenoid which also receives inner-\nvation from the opposite side.\nAetiology\nThyroid  surgery  is  the  most  common  cause  when  both  \nrecurrent and external laryngeal nerves of one side may \nbe involved.\nIt  may  also  occur  in  lesions  of  nucleus  ambiguus  or  \nthat of the vagus nerve proximal to the origin of superior \nlaryngeal nerve. Thus, lesion may lie in the medulla, pos-\nterior  cranial  fossa,  jugular  foramen  or  parapharyngeal  \nspace (Table 60.1).\nClinical Features\nAs  all  the  muscles  of  larynx  on  one  side  are  paralyzed,  \nvocal cord will lie in the cadaveric position, i.e. 3.5 mm \nfrom the midline (Table 60.2).

        "vocal cord will lie in the cadaveric position, i.e. 3.5 mm \nfrom the midline (Table 60.2). The healthy cord is unable \nto  approximate  the  paralyzed  cord,  thus  causing  glottic  \nincompetence. This results in hoarseness of voice and as-\npiration of liquids through the glottis. Cough is ineffec-\ntive due to air waste.\nTreatment\n1. Speech  therapy.  With  proper  speech  therapy,  the  \nhealthy cord may compensate the loss of function of \nparalyzed vocal cord by moving across the midline.\n2. Procedures  to  medialize  the  cord.  In  uncompensat-\ned  cases,  aim  is  to  bring  the  paralyzed  cord  towards  \nthe  midline  so  that  healthy  cord  can  meet  it.  This  is  \nachieved by:\n(a) Injection of teflon paste lateral to the paralyzed cord. \nThis  is  done  by  direct  laryngoscopy  under    local  \n   anaesthesia.

It may flop up and down the glottis during \nrespiration or phonation. Hoarseness is a common symp-\ntom.  Large  polyp  may  cause  dyspnoea,  stridor  or  inter-\nmittent choking. Some patients complain of diplophonia \n(double  voice)  due  to  different  vibratory  frequencies  of  \nthe two vocal cords.\nVocal polyp is caused by sudden shouting resulting in \nhaemorrhage  in  the  vocal  cord  and  subsequent  submu-\ncosal oedema. Treatment is surgical excision under oper-\nating microscope followed by speech therapy.\n3. Reinke’s oedema (bilateral \ndiffuse polyposis)\nThis is due to collection of oedema fluid in the subepitheli-\nal space of Reinke. Usual cause is vocal abuse and smoking. \nBoth  vocal  cords  show  diffuse  symmetrical  swellings.  \nTreatment is longitudinal incision in the cord and removal \nof gelatinous fluid. Re-education in voice production and \ncessation of smoking are essential to prevent recurrence.\n4. Contact ulcer or granuloma\nThis is again due to faulty voice production in which vo-\ncal  processes  of  arytenoids  hammer  against  each  other  \nresulting  in  ulceration  and  granuloma  formation.  Some  \ncases are due to gastric reflux. Chief complaints are hoarse \nvoice,  a  constant  desire  to  clear  the  throat  and  pain  in  \nthe throat which is worse on phonation. Examination re-\nveals unilateral or bilateral ulcers on the vocal processes \nof arytenoids with mucosal congestion over the arytenoid \ncartilages. There may be granuloma formation.\nManagement consists of\n(a) Antireflux therapy.\n(b)  Speech therapy to stop throat clearing and correct the \npitch of voice.\n(c)    Inhaled  steroids  or  intralesional  injection  of  steroid  \nto   correct   inflammation   and   size   of   granuloma.   \nMicrolaryngeal  surgery  may  be  needed  to  remove  \ngranuloma.\n5. Intubation granuloma\nIt results from injury to vocal processes of arytenoids due \nto rough intubation, use of large tube or prolonged pres-\nence  of  tube  between  the  cords.  Mucosal  ulceration  is  \nfollowed by granuloma formation over the exposed carti-\nlage. Usually, they are bilateral involving posterior thirds \nof true cords. They present with hoarseness and if large, \ndyspnoea as well. Treatment is voice rest and endoscopic \nremoval of the granuloma.\n6. Leukoplakia or keratosis\nThis  is  also  a  localized  form  of  epithelial  hyperplasia  \ninvolving  upper  surface  of  one  or  both  vocal  cords.

Ventricular dysphonia \nsecondary  to  laryngeal  disorders  is  difficult  to  treat  but  \nthe functional type can be helped through voice therapy \nand psychological counselling.\nFUNCTIONAL APHONIA (HYSTERICAL \nAPHONIA)\nIt is a functional disorder mostly seen in emotionally la-\nbile females in the age group of 15–30 years. Aphonia is \nusually  sudden  and  unaccompanied  by  other  laryngeal  \nsymptoms.  Patient  communicates  with  whisper.  On  ex-\namination, vocal cords are seen in abducted position and \nfail to adduct on phonation; however, adduction of vocal \ncords can be seen on coughing, indicating normal adduc-\ntor  function.  Even  though  patient  is  aphonic,  sound  of  \ncough is good. Treatment given is to reassure the patient \nof normal laryngeal function and psychotherapy.\nPUBERPHONIA (MUTATIONAL \nFALSETTO VOICE)\nNormally,  childhood  voice  has  a  higher  pitch.  When  \nthe  larynx  matures  at  puberty,  vocal  cords  lengthen  and  \nthe  voice  changes  to  one  of  lower  pitch.  This  is  a  fea-\nture  exclusive  to  males.  Failure  of  this  change  leads  to  \npersistence of childhood high-pitched voice and is called \npuberphonia.  It  is  seen  in  boys  who  are  emotionally  im-\nmature, feel insecure and show excessive fixation to their \nmother. Psychologically, they shun to assume male respon-\nsibilities though their physical and sexual development is \nnormal.  Treatment  is  training  the  body  to  produce  low-\npitched voice. Pressing the thyroid prominence in a back-\nward  and  downward  direction  relaxes  the  overstretched  \ncords  and  low  tone  voice  can  be  produced  (Gutzmann’s  \npressure  test).  The  patient  pressing  on  his  larynx  learns  \nto produce low tone voice and then trains himself to pro-\nduce syllables, words and numbers. Prognosis is good.\nPHONASTHENIA\nIt is weakness of voice due to fatigue of phonatory mus-\ncles. Thyroarytenoid and interarytenoids or both may be \naffected. It is seen in abuse or misuse of voice or following \nlaryngitis. Patient complains of easy fatiguability of voice. \nIndirect laryngoscopy shows three characteristic findings:\n1. Elliptical space between the cords in weakness of thy-\nroarytenoid.\n2. Triangular gap near the posterior commissure in weak-\nness of interarytenoid.\n3.  Key-hole  appearance  of  glottis  when  both  thyroaryt-\nenoid and interarytenoids are involved (Figure 63.1).\nTreatment  is  voice  rest  and  vocal  hygiene,  emphasiz-\ning on periods of voice rest after excessive use of voice.\nDYSPHONIA\nDysphonia can be divided into three types: adductor, ab-\nductor and mixed.\nADDUCTOR DYSPHONIA\nThe adductor muscles of larynx go into spasm causing vo-\ncal cords to go into adduction. Voice becomes strained or \nstrangled, and phonation is interrupted in between lead-\ning  to  voice  breaks.  Larynx  is  however  morphologically  \nnormal.  Severity  of  the  condition  differs  from  mild  and  \nintermittent symptoms to those with moderate or severe \ndysphonia. Flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy is useful dur-\ning which patient’s speech, sustained phonation and res-\npiratory activities are studied. Patient may have tremors \nof larynx, palate and pharynx.\nAetiology of the condition is uncertain but one should \nexclude  neurological  conditions  such  as  Parkinsonism,  \nmyoclonus,  pseudobulbar  palsy,  multiple  sclerosis,  cer-\nebellar disorders, tardive dyskinesia and amyotrophic lat-\neral sclerosis. CT scan and MRI are not useful but help to \nrule out neurological conditions.\nTreatment  consists  of  botulinum  toxin  injections  in  \nthe thyroarytenoid muscle on one or both sides to relieve \nspasm.  Percutaneous  electromyography  (EMG)  guided  \nroute  through  cricothyroid  space  is  preferred.  Dose  of  \nbotulinum  toxin  depends  on  severity  of  the  condition.  \nToxin  injections  relieve  voice  breaks  due  to  spasms  and  \nimprove airflow but the benefit lasts only up to 16 weeks \nor so when repeat injection may be needed. Sometimes, if \ndose of toxin is not regulated it may cause breathiness of \nvoice and discomfort to swallow.\nVoice  therapy  is  useful  to  improve  voice  and  the  du-\nration  of  benefit.  Voice  therapy  alone  without  injection  \ndoes  not  help  much.  Earlier  disease  was  considered  to  \nbe  psychological  in  origin  but  psychotherapy  was  not  \nfound  useful.  Section  of  recurrent  laryngeal  to  paralyze  \nthe cord/cords has been used in the past but it interferes \nwith  glottic  closure  leading  to  breathy  and  weak  voice  \nand  swallowing  discomfort.  This  treatment  is  still  used  \nwhen injection treatment fails and the spasms are severe.\nABDUCTOR DYSPHONIA\nIt  is  due  to  spasms  of  posterior  cricoarytenoid  muscle  (the  \nonly  abductor)  and  thus  keeping  the  glottis  open.  Patient  \ngets a breathy voice or breathy breaks in voice. The condi-\ntion is gradually progressive and the symptoms get aggravat-\ned during periods of stress or when patient uses telephone.\nFigure  63.1.  Appearances  of  glottis  in  phonasthenia.

Sometimes,  the  term  tracheotomy  has  been  in-\nterchangeably  used  but  the  latter  actually  means  open-\ning  the  trachea,  which  is  a  step  in  the  tracheostomy  \noperation.\nFUNCTIONS OF TRACHEOSTOMY\n1. Alternative pathway for breathing. This circumvents \nany  obstruction  in  the  upper  airway  from  lips  to  the  \ntracheostome.\n2. Improves alveolar ventilation. In cases of respiratory \ninsufficiency, alveolar ventilation is improved by:\n(a)  Decreasing  the  dead  space  by  30–50%  (normal  \ndead space is 150 mL).\n(b) Reducing the resistance to airflow.\n3. Protects  the  airways.  By  using  cuffed  tube,  tracheo-\nbronchial tree is protected against aspiration of:\n(a) Pharyngeal secretions, as in case of bulbar paraly-\nsis or coma.\n(b) Blood, as in haemorrhage from pharynx, larynx or \nmaxillofacial injuries. With tracheostomy, pharynx \nand larynx can also be packed to control bleeding.\n4. Permits  removal  of  tracheobronchial  secretions. \nWhen patient is unable to cough as in coma, head in-\njuries, respiratory paralysis; or when cough is painful, \nas in chest injuries or upper abdominal operations, the \ntracheobronchial  airway  can  be  kept  clean  of  secre-\ntions  by  repeated  suction  through  the  tracheostomy,  \nthus  avoiding  need  for  repeated  bronchoscopy  or  in-\ntubation which is not only traumatic but also requires \nexpertise.\n5.

It  is  employed  when  \nairway  obstruction  is  complete  or  almost  complete  and  \nthere  is  an  urgent  need  to  establish  the  airway.  Intuba-\ntion or laryngotomy are either not possible or feasible in \nsuch cases.\n2. electiVe tracheostomy (syn. tranquil, orderly \nor routine tracheostomy). This is a planned, unhur-\nried procedure. Almost all operative surgical facilities are \navailable, endotracheal tube can be put and local or gen-\neral anaesthesia can be given. It is of two types:\n(a) Therapeutic, to relieve respiratory obstruction, remove \ntracheobronchial  secretions  or  give  assisted  ventila-\ntion.\n(b) Prophylactic,  to  guard  against  anticipated  respiratory  \nobstruction or aspiration of blood or pharyngeal se-\ncretions such as in extensive surgery of tongue, floor \nof mouth, mandibular resection or laryngofissure.\nElective tracheostomy is often temporary and is closed \nwhen indication is over.\n3. permanent  tracheostomy.

Trachea of infants and children is soft and compress-\nible and its identification may become difficult and the \nsurgeon  may  easily  displace  it  and  go  deep  or  lateral  \nto it injuring recurrent laryngeal nerve or even the ca-\nrotid. It is always useful to have an endotracheal tube \nor a bronchoscope inserted into trachea before opera-\ntion.  Tracheostomy  in  infants  and  children  is  prefer-\nably done under general anaesthesia.\n2. During positioning, do not extend the neck too much \nas  this  pulls  structures  from  chest  into  the  neck  and  \nthus  injury  may  occur  to  pleura,  innominate  vessels  \nand  thymus  or  the  tracheostomy  opening  may  be  \nmade too low near suprasternal notch.\n3.  Before  incising  trachea,  silk  sutures  are  placed  in  the  \ntrachea, on either side of midline.\n4. Tracheal lumen is small, do not insert knife too deep; it \nwill injure posterior tracheal wall or even oesophagus \ncausing tracheo-oesophageal fistula.\n5.  Trachea  is  simply  incised,  without  excising  a  circular  \npiece of tracheal wall.\n6. Avoid infolding of anterior tracheal wall when insert-\ning the tracheostomy tube.\n7. Selection of tube is important. It should be of proper \ndiameter, length and curvature. A long tube impinges \non the carina or right bronchus. With high curvature, \nlower  end  of  tube  impinges  on  anterior  tracheal  wall  \nwhile upper part compresses the tracheal rings or cri-\ncoid (see Appendix II, p. 509).\n8.  Use  soft  silastic  or  portex  tube.  Metallic  tubes  cause  \nmore trauma.\n9.  Take  a  postoperative  X-ray  of  the  neck  and  chest  to  \nascertain the position of the tracheostomy tube.\nPOSTOPERATIVE CARE\n1. Constant  supervision.  After  tracheostomy,  constant  \nsupervision  of  the  patient  for  bleeding,  displacement  \nor blocking of tube and removal of secretions is essen-\ntial. A nurse or patient’s relative should be in attend-\nance. Patient is given a bell or a paper pad and a pencil \nto communicate.\n2. Suction. Depending on the amount of secretion, suc-\ntion may be required every half an hour or so; use ster-\nile catheters with a Y-connector to break suction force. \nSuction injuries to tracheal mucosa should be avoided. \nThis is done by applying suction to the catheter only \nwhen withdrawing it (Figure 64.3).\n3. Prevention of crusting and tracheitis. This is achieved \nby\n(a) Proper humidification, by use of humidifier, steam \ntent, ultrasonic nebulizer or keeping a boiling ket-\ntle in the room.\n(b) If crusting occurs, a few drops of normal or hypo-\ntonic saline or Ringer’s lactate are instilled into the \ntrachea every 2–3 h to loosen crusts. A mucolytic \nagent  such  as  acetylcysteine  solution  can  be  in-\nstilled to liquify tenacious secretions or to loosen \nthe crusts.\n4. Care of tracheostomy tube. Inner cannula should be \nremoved  and  cleaned  as  and  when  indicated  for  the  \nfirst  3  days.  Outer  tube,  unless  blocked  or  displaced,  \nshould  not  be  removed  for  3–4  days  to  allow  a  track  \nto be formed when tube placement will become easy. \nAfter 3–4 days, outer tube can be removed and cleaned \nevery day.\nIf cuffed tube is used, it should be periodically deflated \nto prevent pressure necrosis or dilatation of trachea.\nDecannulation.  Tracheostomy  tube  should  not  be  \nkept longer than necessary. Prolonged use of tube leads to \ntracheobronchial infections, tracheal ulceration, granula-\ntions, stenosis and unsightly scars.\nTo decannulate a patient, tracheostomy tube is plugged \nand the patient closely observed. If the patient can toler-\nate  it  for  24  h,  tube  can  be  safely  removed.  In  children,  \nthe  above  procedure  is  done  using  a  smaller  tube.

During positioning, do not extend the neck too much \nas  this  pulls  structures  from  chest  into  the  neck  and  \nthus  injury  may  occur  to  pleura,  innominate  vessels  \nand  thymus  or  the  tracheostomy  opening  may  be  \nmade too low near suprasternal notch.\n3.  Before  incising  trachea,  silk  sutures  are  placed  in  the  \ntrachea, on either side of midline.\n4. Tracheal lumen is small, do not insert knife too deep; it \nwill injure posterior tracheal wall or even oesophagus \ncausing tracheo-oesophageal fistula.\n5.  Trachea  is  simply  incised,  without  excising  a  circular  \npiece of tracheal wall.\n6. Avoid infolding of anterior tracheal wall when insert-\ning the tracheostomy tube.\n7. Selection of tube is important. It should be of proper",
        "piece of tracheal wall.\n6. Avoid infolding of anterior tracheal wall when insert-\ning the tracheostomy tube.\n7. Selection of tube is important. It should be of proper \ndiameter, length and curvature. A long tube impinges \non the carina or right bronchus. With high curvature, \nlower  end  of  tube  impinges  on  anterior  tracheal  wall  \nwhile upper part compresses the tracheal rings or cri-\ncoid (see Appendix II, p. 509).\n8.  Use  soft  silastic  or  portex  tube.  Metallic  tubes  cause  \nmore trauma.\n9.  Take  a  postoperative  X-ray  of  the  neck  and  chest  to  \nascertain the position of the tracheostomy tube.\nPOSTOPERATIVE CARE\n1. Constant  supervision.  After  tracheostomy,  constant  \nsupervision  of  the  patient  for  bleeding,  displacement  \nor blocking of tube and removal of secretions is essen-\ntial.

        "or blocking of tube and removal of secretions is essen-\ntial. A nurse or patient’s relative should be in attend-\nance. Patient is given a bell or a paper pad and a pencil \nto communicate.\n2. Suction. Depending on the amount of secretion, suc-\ntion may be required every half an hour or so; use ster-\nile catheters with a Y-connector to break suction force. \nSuction injuries to tracheal mucosa should be avoided. \nThis is done by applying suction to the catheter only \nwhen withdrawing it (Figure 64.3).\n3. Prevention of crusting and tracheitis. This is achieved \nby\n(a) Proper humidification, by use of humidifier, steam \ntent, ultrasonic nebulizer or keeping a boiling ket-\ntle in the room.\n(b) If crusting occurs, a few drops of normal or hypo-\ntonic saline or Ringer’s lactate are instilled into the \ntrachea every 2–3 h to loosen crusts. A mucolytic \nagent  such  as  acetylcysteine  solution  can  be  in-\nstilled to liquify tenacious secretions or to loosen \nthe crusts.",

Care of tracheostomy tube. Inner cannula should be \nremoved  and  cleaned  as  and  when  indicated  for  the  \nfirst  3  days.  Outer  tube,  unless  blocked  or  displaced,  \nshould  not  be  removed  for  3–4  days  to  allow  a  track  \nto be formed when tube placement will become easy. \nAfter 3–4 days, outer tube can be removed and cleaned \nevery day.\nIf cuffed tube is used, it should be periodically deflated \nto prevent pressure necrosis or dilatation of trachea.\nDecannulation.  Tracheostomy  tube  should  not  be  \nkept longer than necessary. Prolonged use of tube leads to \ntracheobronchial infections, tracheal ulceration, granula-\ntions, stenosis and unsightly scars.\nTo decannulate a patient, tracheostomy tube is plugged \nand the patient closely observed.

A large bolus of food obstructed \nabove  the  cords  may  make  the  patient  totally  aphonic,  \nunable to cry for help. He may die of asphyxia unless im-\nmediate  first  aid  measures  are  taken.  The  measures  con-\nsist of pounding on the back, turning the patient upside \ndown  and  following  Heimlich  manoeuvre.  These  meas-\nures  should  not  be  done  if  patient  is  only  partially  ob-\nstructed, for fear of causing total obstruction.\nHeimlich manoeuvre. Stand behind the person and place \nyour arms around his lower chest and give four abdomi-\nnal thrusts. The residual air in the lungs may dislodge the \nforeign body providing some airway (Figure 65.7).\nCricothyrotomy  or  emergency  tracheostomy  should  \nbe done if Heimlich manoeuvre fails. Once acute respira-\ntory emergency is over, foreign body can be removed by \ndirect laryngoscopy or by laryngofissure, if impacted.\nTracheal  and  bronchial  foreign  bodies  can  be  re-\nmoved by bronchoscopy with full preparation and under \ngeneral anaesthesia. Emergency removal of these foreign \nbodies is not indicated unless there is airway obstruction \nor they are of the vegetable nature (e.g. seeds) and likely \nto swell up.\nMethods to remove tracheobronchial foreign body:\n1. Conventional rigid bronchoscopy.\n2. Rigid bronchoscopy with telescopic aid.\n3. Bronchoscopy with C-arm fluoroscopy.\n4. Use of Dormia basket or Fogarty’s balloon for rounded \nobjects.\n5.  Tracheostomy  first  and  then  bronchoscopy  through  \nthe tracheostome.\n6. Thoracotomy and bronchotomy for peripheral foreign \nbodies.\n7. Flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy in selected adult pa-\ntients.\nEquipment for foreign body removal include:\n1. Bronchoscope, appropriate for the age of patient and a \nsize smaller and the other a size larger (see p. 523).\n2. Telescope or optical forceps.\n3. Two laryngoscopes.\n4.  Foreign  body  forceps,  Dormia  basket,  Fogarty’s  cath-\neter and a syringe to inflate it.\nFigure 65.5.

Stand behind the person and place \nyour arms around his lower chest and give four abdomi-\nnal thrusts. The residual air in the lungs may dislodge the \nforeign body providing some airway (Figure 65.7).\nCricothyrotomy  or  emergency  tracheostomy  should  \nbe done if Heimlich manoeuvre fails.

Emergency removal of these foreign \nbodies is not indicated unless there is airway obstruction \nor they are of the vegetable nature (e.g. seeds) and likely \nto swell up.\nMethods to remove tracheobronchial foreign body:\n1. Conventional rigid bronchoscopy.\n2. Rigid bronchoscopy with telescopic aid.\n3. Bronchoscopy with C-arm fluoroscopy.\n4. Use of Dormia basket or Fogarty’s balloon for rounded \nobjects.\n5.

Its apex is directed interiorly at tho-\nracic inlet. RLN runs through this triangle from lateral to \nmedial side on the right and straight up along tracheoe-\nsophageal groove on the left.\nLINGUAL THYROID (FIGURE 66.3)\nIt is seen in 1:3000 to 1:4000 patients of thyroid disease. \nIt  may  be  the  only  thyroid  tissue  or  be  present  in  addi-\ntion to normal thyroid or an ectopic thyroid. When large \nit causes airway obstruction or difficulty to swallow. It is \nseen as a mass at the base of tongue on indirect laryngos-\ncopy. It should be differentiated from other masses occur-\nring at the base of tongue, i.e. lymphoma, squamous cell \ncarcinoma, minor salivary gland tumour, lingual tonsil or \nrarely thyroglossal cyst. Surgical removal should be done, \nif lingual thyroid causes symptoms of airway obstruction \nor  dysphagia  by  suprahyoid  transpharyngeal  approach.  \nIt requires lifelong replacement of thyroid hormone, if it \nwas the only thyroid tissue.\nPHYSIOLOGY OF THYROID\nThyroid gland contains two types of cells:\n(i) follicular cells which synthesize and liberate T\n4\n (thy-\nroxine)  and  T\n3\n  (tri-iodothyronine)  and  (ii)  parafollicular  \n’C’  cells  which  liberate  calcitonin  which  has  a  calcium  \nlowering effect (Figure 66.4).\nSynthesis and release of thyroid hormones take place \nthrough five steps:\n1. Active uptake of iodide.\n2. Oxidation of iodide to iodine and binding of iodine to \ntyrosine  molecule  to  form  diiodotyrosine  or  monoio-\ndotyrosine.

Familial. Five to ten per cent of patients with papillary \nthyroid carcinoma (PTC) have family history of thyroid \ncancer. Cowden syndrome consists of multiple hamarto-\nmas, breast tumours, skin tags and follicular or papillary \ncancer. Gardner’s  syndrome  consists  of  familial  colonic  \npolyposis  with  thyroid  cancer.  Papillary  carcinoma  is  \nseen  in  areas  with  adequate  iodine  intake  unlike  folli-\ncular carcinoma which is more common in low-iodine \nintake areas with endemic goitre. Tumour may be mul-\nticentric in origin either because of intrathyroidal lym-\nphatic spread or de novo multicentric origin.\nClinical presentation\nPTC may present with the following symptoms:\n1. An asymptomatic mass in the thyroid.\n2.  Metastatic  nodes  in  the  neck.  About  one-third  of  pa-\ntients have palpable neck nodes.\n3. Depending on local invasion, mass in the thyroid may \nproduce symptoms of local invasion of strap muscles, \ntrachea, oesophagus or laryngeal nerves.\n4. Pulmonary or bone metastases with or without a mass \nin the neck; occult primary of the thyroid may present \nwith metastases.\nDiagnosis\nHistory,  clinical  examination  and  FNAC  are  important.  \nUltrasound  of  the  thyroid  and  the  neck  is  important  to  \nlook for other lesions in thyroid (as the disease is multifo-\ncal)  and  also  involvement  of  neck  nodes.  Thyroid  func-\ntion  tests  may  reveal  hyperthyroidism  though  most  of  \nthe patients are euthyroid. X-ray chest may show pulmo-\nnary  metastases.  CT/MRI  may  be  required  for  extent  of  \ndisease or retrosternal extension.\nTreatment\n1. Microcarcinoma, which is less than 1.5 cm, hardly pal-\npable  clinically  with  no  capsular  invasion  or  cervical  \nnodes and mostly discovered incidentally at the opera-\ntion, is treated with lobectomy with isthmusectomy.\n2. Intrathyroidal tumour more than 1.5 cm with no nod-\nule on contralateral side and no palpable neck nodes, \nalso requires a lobectomy with isthmusectomy.\n3. Gross disease in both lobes seen on preoperative ultra-\nsound or on palpation at the time of operation with no \ncervical nodes requires a total or near total thyroidec-\ntomy.\n4. High-risk patients require total thyroidectomy.\n5. Tracheal invasion requires tracheal segmental excision \nand repair in addition to the excision of growth.\n6.  Cervical  lymph  node  dissection  is  done  if  nodes  are  \npalpable. There is no role of elective neck dissection.\nFollow-up\nAfter  total  thyroidectomy,  disease  may  sometimes  be  \nleft in the ligament of Berry, pyramidal lobe or superior \npoles of thyroid and requires postoperative radioiodine \nablation.\nFOLLICULAR CARCINOMA\nIt  arises  from  the  follicular  cells  of  the  thyroid.  It  con-\nstitutes  about  10-15%  of  thyroid  malignancies.  Usually  \npresents at age 50 and is more common in females (3:1).\nClinically, it presents either as a solitary thyroid nod-\nule or a rapid increase in a pre-existent nodule.\nMore  often  it  spreads  by  blood  stream  and  thus  may  \nhave distant metastases at presentation in 10-15% of pa-\ntients. Unlike papillary cancer, lymph node involvement \nis less common and if it occurs, indicates extensive spread \nlocally.\nFNAC may be reported as follicular neoplasm. It is only \nafter surgical removal of the specimen that carcinoma can \nbe  diagnosed  as  the  latter  requires  capsular  or  vascular  \ninvasion.\nTreatment\n1. If diagnosed as follicular neoplasm on FNAC (not can-\ncer), lobectomy with isthmusectomy should be done. \nInclude also the pyramidal lobe.\n If lobectomy specimen is reported as carcinoma, com-\npletion of thyroidectomy is done i.e. removal of other \nlobe as well. It can be followed by radioiodine scan and \nablation of metastatic disease.\n2. If diagnosed follicular carcinoma on FNAC, total thy-\nroidectomy should be performed.\n3. If nodule size is greater than 4 cm in an elderly person \nand  is  reported  as  follicular  neoplasm,  perform  total  \nthyroidectomy due to the risk of its being carcinoma.\nNeck dissection is done only if nodes are palpable. Pro-\nphylactic neck dissection has no role.\nPrognosis of follicular carcinoma is poor if age at pres-\nentation is more than 50 years, size is more than 4 cm or \ndistant metastases are present.\nHURTHLE CELL CARCINOMA\nIt  is  also  called  oncocytic  carcinoma.  Oncocytes  are  large  \ncells  which  are  rich  in  mitochondria  and  stain  pink.  It  \nmay be multifocal, bilateral and spreads to regional nodes \nor sends distant metastases.

However, if level VI nodes are involved, a com-\nprehensive neck dissection (level II–V) is also performed. \nIf  primary  lesion  is  more  than  2  cm,  ipsilateral  elective  \nneck  dissection  should  be  done.  Level  VII  nodes  should  \nalso be removed.\nPheochromocytoma, if associated, should be removed \nbefore thyroidectomy to avoid hypertensive crisis during \noperation.\nPostoperative  follow-up  is  done  by  measuring  cal-\ncitonin  levels  for  any  residual,  recurrent  or  metastatic  \ndisease.\nRadioactive  iodine  and  chemotherapy  are  not  effec-\ntive. Role of external beam radiation is also controversial.\nLYMPHOMA\nMost of the thyroid lymphomas are B-cell non-Hodgkin \ntype. They are seen in the age group of 60-80 years and \nare more common in females (ratio of 3:1). Pre-existing \nHashimoto  disease  predisposes  to  lymphoma  forma-\ntion.\nClinically,  a  lymphoma  presents  like  an  anaplastic  \nthyroid  cancer,  with  rapidly  growing  painless  thyroid  \nmass  which  invades  the  surrounding  structures  leading  \nto  hoarseness,  stridor,  dyspnoea,  dysphagia  and  thorac-\nic  inlet  obstruction.  Cervical  lymph  nodes  are  enlarged.  \nLymph  node  enlargement  can  occur  in  other  regions  of  \nbody as well depending on the stage of disease. Patient is \noften hypothyroid.\nHistologically,  lymphoma  needs  to  be  differentiated  \nfrom anaplastic carcinoma and Hashimoto disease by im-\nmunohistochemistry.  Therefore  it  may  require  FNAB  or  \nisthmusectomy to have enough tissue; the latter also de-\ncompresses the trachea to relieve airway obstruction.\nTreatment depends on the stage of disease. Surgery, ex-\nternal beam radiation and chemotherapy have been used \ndepending on the stage. Role of surgery may be limited to \nopen biopsy only or a tracheostomy or removal of early \ndisease when it is localized to thyroid (stage I) or thyroid \nand  the  neck  nodes  (stage  II).  Radiotherapy  can  also  be  \nused  in  such  cases  of  stage  I  and  II  but  for  a  disease  of  \nstage  III  (both  sides  of  diaphragm)  or  stage  IV  (dissemi-\nnated disease) radiotherapy and chemotherapy are com-\nbined.\nMETASTASES TO THYROID\nMalignant disease of breast, kidney, lung, and squamous \ncell  cancers  of  head  and  neck  and  melanomas  can  send  \nmetastases to the thyroid and present as a nodule.

Their  incidence  increases  as  the  age  advances.  \nAbout 5-10% of the nodules may be malignant. Risk of a \nnodule being malignant increases if the patient received \nradiation in childhood.

Carcinoma\n8. Metastatic deposits in thyroid (rare)\nThe main consideration in a thyroid nodule is to pick \nup cases of carcinoma. Of all the palpable nodules, only \nabout 5-10% will be malignant.\nColloid nodule (or adenomatous nodule)\nIt is a benign condition, clinically resembling an adeno-\nma, hence called adenomatous. It is due to hyperplasia of \nfollicular  cells  with  the  follicles  filled  with  colloid.  TSH  \nlevel is normal but hyperplasia of follicular cells is attrib-\nuted  to  their  being  more  sensitive  to  the  action  of  TSH.  \nLowering  the  TSH  by  administering  exogenous  thyroid  \nhormone (suppressive therapy) is used to treat such nod-\nules  but  it  is  difficult  to  predict  which  nodules  will  re-\nspond to this form of therapy.\nFollicular adenoma\nIt  is  a  well-demarcated,  encapsulated  and  true  benign  \nneoplasm of follicular cells. It may undergo cystic degen-\neration, haemorrhage, calcification and fibrosis. It is diffi-\ncult to differentiate it from follicular carcinoma on FNAC \nbecause  diagnosis  of  carcinoma  requires  vascular  and/or  \ncapsular invasion which is possible only on histology of \nthe mass removed.\nHurthle cell adenoma\nHurthle  cells  are  oncocytes,  rich  in  mitochondria.  Like  \nfollicular adenoma, it is also well-demarcated and encap-\nsulated. An adenoma of Hurthle cell cannot be differenti-\nated  from  Hurthle  cell  carcinoma  on  FNAC  as  the  diag-\nnosis of latter requires capsular and/or vascular invasion.\nThyroid cyst\nAbout one-fourth of the thyroid nodules present as a cyst \nor a cystic component in a nodule.

      "content": "387\nChapter 68\nDisorders of Oesophagus\nACUTE OESOPHAGITIS\nIt  is  acute  inflammation  of  the  oesophagus  and  can  be  \ndue to (i) ingestion of hot liquids, (ii) ingestion of caus-\ntic  or  corrosive  agents,  (iii)  laceration  due  to  swallowed  \nforeign body, or trauma of oesophagoscopy, (iv) monilial \ninfection  of  oesophagus  from  thrush  in  the  oral  cavity  \nand (v) systemic disorder like pemphigus.\nPatient  complains  of  dysphagia,  retrosternal  burning  \nor  haematemesis.  Diagnosis  can  be  made  from  history,  \nX-ray studies and oesophagoscopy.\nPERFORATION OF OESOPHAGUS\nAETIOLOGY\nPerforation or the rupture of oesophagus results from:\n1. Instrumental  trauma,  i.e.  oesophagoscopy  or  dilata-\ntion  of  strictures  with  bougies.  The  common  site  or  \nrupture in these cases is just above the upper sphincter; \nsometimes it is the lower oesophagus near the hiatus.\n2. Spontaneous  rupture.  This  usually  follows  vomiting  \nand  involves  mostly  the  lower  third  of  oesophagus.  \nPostemetic  rupture  of  all  the  layers  of  oesophagus  is  \ncalled Boerhaave syndrome.\nDIAGNOSIS\nEarly  diagnosis  is  imperative,  as  mediastinitis,  resulting  \nfrom  rupture,  can  rapidly  prove  fatal.  All  patients  com-\nplaining of pain in the neck or interscapular region, fol-\nlowing an oesophagoscopy, should be suspected of a per-\nforation.\nThe features of cervical oesophageal rupture are pain, fe-\nver, difficulty to swallow and local tenderness, along with \nsigns of surgical emphysema in the neck.\nThe features of thoracic oesophageal rupture are pain, re-\nferred to the interscapular region, fever 102–104 °F (39–\n40 °C), signs of shock, surgical emphysema in the neck, \ncrunching sound over the heart (Hamman’s sign, because \nof air in the mediastinum) and pneumothorax.\nX-rays  of  the  chest  and  neck  are  essential.  They  may  \nreveal  widening  of  the  mediastinum  and  retrovisceral  \nspace, surgical emphysema, pneumothorax, pleural effu-\nsion or gas under the diaphragm.\nTREATMENT\nAll oral feeds are stopped immediately. Nutrition is main-\ntained through i.v. route. Massive doses of antibiotics are \ngiven i.v. to combat infection.\nEarly perforations of cervical oesophagus can be man-\naged by conservative measures; drainage is required only \nif suppuration develops. Retrovisceral space and/or upper \nmediastinum can be drained through the neck.\nRupture  of  thoracic  oesophagus  is  more  serious  and  \nconservative  treatment  rarely  succeeds.  If  diagnosis  is  \nmade early (within 6 h), perforation is surgically repaired \nand pleural cavity drained. If diagnosis is delayed, repair \nis  not  possible;  surgery  is  then  restricted  to  drainage  of  \nthe infected area.\nCORROSIVE BURNS OF OESOPHAGUS\nAETIOLOGY\nAcids, alkalies or other chemicals may be swallowed acci-\ndentally in children or taken with the purpose of suicide \nin adults.\nPATHOLOGY\nSeverity  of  oesophageal  burns  depends  on  the  nature  of  \ncorrosive  substance,  its  quantity  and  concentration  and  the  \nduration of its contact with the oesophageal wall. Alkalies \nare more destructive and penetrate deep into the layers of \nthe  oesophagus.  With  lye  burns,  entire  oesophagus  and  \nstomach  may  slough  off  causing  fatal  mediastinitis  and  \nperitonitis.\nOesophageal burns run through three stages:\n1. Stages of acute necrosis.\n2. Stage of granulations: Slough separates leaving granu-\nlating ulcer.\n3. Stage of stricture: Stricture formation begins at 2 weeks \nand continues for 2 months or longer.\nEVALUATION OF PATIENTS\nEvaluate  the  patient  and  determine  the  type  of  caustic  \ningested, signs and symptoms of shock, upper airway ob-\nstruction, mediastinitis, peritonitis, acid-base imbalance, \nand  associated  burns  of  face,  lips  and  oral  cavity.  Take  \nX-ray of the chest and soft tissue lateral view of neck.\nMANAGEMENT\n1. Hospitalize the patient.\n2. Treat shock and acid-base imbalance by i.v. fluids and \nelectrolytes.

        "387\nChapter 68\nDisorders of Oesophagus\nACUTE OESOPHAGITIS\nIt  is  acute  inflammation  of  the  oesophagus  and  can  be  \ndue to (i) ingestion of hot liquids, (ii) ingestion of caus-\ntic  or  corrosive  agents,  (iii)  laceration  due  to  swallowed  \nforeign body, or trauma of oesophagoscopy, (iv) monilial \ninfection  of  oesophagus  from  thrush  in  the  oral  cavity  \nand (v) systemic disorder like pemphigus.\nPatient  complains  of  dysphagia,  retrosternal  burning  \nor  haematemesis.  Diagnosis  can  be  made  from  history,  \nX-ray studies and oesophagoscopy.\nPERFORATION OF OESOPHAGUS\nAETIOLOGY\nPerforation or the rupture of oesophagus results from:\n1. Instrumental  trauma,  i.e.  oesophagoscopy  or  dilata-\ntion  of  strictures  with  bougies.  The  common  site  or  \nrupture in these cases is just above the upper sphincter; \nsometimes it is the lower oesophagus near the hiatus.\n2. Spontaneous  rupture.

        "rupture in these cases is just above the upper sphincter; \nsometimes it is the lower oesophagus near the hiatus.\n2. Spontaneous  rupture.  This  usually  follows  vomiting  \nand  involves  mostly  the  lower  third  of  oesophagus.  \nPostemetic  rupture  of  all  the  layers  of  oesophagus  is  \ncalled Boerhaave syndrome.\nDIAGNOSIS\nEarly  diagnosis  is  imperative,  as  mediastinitis,  resulting  \nfrom  rupture,  can  rapidly  prove  fatal.  All  patients  com-\nplaining of pain in the neck or interscapular region, fol-\nlowing an oesophagoscopy, should be suspected of a per-\nforation.\nThe features of cervical oesophageal rupture are pain, fe-\nver, difficulty to swallow and local tenderness, along with \nsigns of surgical emphysema in the neck.\nThe features of thoracic oesophageal rupture are pain, re-\nferred to the interscapular region, fever 102–104 °F (39–\n40 °C), signs of shock, surgical emphysema in the neck, \ncrunching sound over the heart (Hamman’s sign, because",

They  may  \nreveal  widening  of  the  mediastinum  and  retrovisceral  \nspace, surgical emphysema, pneumothorax, pleural effu-\nsion or gas under the diaphragm.\nTREATMENT\nAll oral feeds are stopped immediately. Nutrition is main-\ntained through i.v. route. Massive doses of antibiotics are \ngiven i.v. to combat infection.\nEarly perforations of cervical oesophagus can be man-\naged by conservative measures; drainage is required only \nif suppuration develops. Retrovisceral space and/or upper \nmediastinum can be drained through the neck.\nRupture  of  thoracic  oesophagus  is  more  serious  and  \nconservative  treatment  rarely  succeeds.  If  diagnosis  is  \nmade early (within 6 h), perforation is surgically repaired",
        "Rupture  of  thoracic  oesophagus  is  more  serious  and  \nconservative  treatment  rarely  succeeds.  If  diagnosis  is  \nmade early (within 6 h), perforation is surgically repaired \nand pleural cavity drained. If diagnosis is delayed, repair \nis  not  possible;  surgery  is  then  restricted  to  drainage  of  \nthe infected area.\nCORROSIVE BURNS OF OESOPHAGUS\nAETIOLOGY\nAcids, alkalies or other chemicals may be swallowed acci-\ndentally in children or taken with the purpose of suicide \nin adults.\nPATHOLOGY\nSeverity  of  oesophageal  burns  depends  on  the  nature  of  \ncorrosive  substance,  its  quantity  and  concentration  and  the  \nduration of its contact with the oesophageal wall. Alkalies \nare more destructive and penetrate deep into the layers of \nthe  oesophagus.  With  lye  burns,  entire  oesophagus  and  \nstomach  may  slough  off  causing  fatal  mediastinitis  and  \nperitonitis.\nOesophageal burns run through three stages:\n1.

Stage of granulations: Slough separates leaving granu-\nlating ulcer.\n3. Stage of stricture: Stricture formation begins at 2 weeks \nand continues for 2 months or longer.\nEVALUATION OF PATIENTS\nEvaluate  the  patient  and  determine  the  type  of  caustic  \ningested, signs and symptoms of shock, upper airway ob-\nstruction, mediastinitis, peritonitis, acid-base imbalance, \nand  associated  burns  of  face,  lips  and  oral  cavity.  Take  \nX-ray of the chest and soft tissue lateral view of neck.\nMANAGEMENT\n1. Hospitalize the patient.\n2. Treat shock and acid-base imbalance by i.v. fluids and \nelectrolytes.

The common causes are:\n1. Burns due to corrosive substances or hot fluids.\n2.  Trauma  to  oesophageal  wall  due  to  impacted  foreign  \nbodies or instrumentation or external injuries.\n3. Ulcerations due to reflux oesophagitis.\n4. Ulcerations due to diphtheria or typhoid.\n5. Sites of surgical anastomosis.\n6.

When obstruction is complete, regurgi-\ntation and cough may occur. Patient is malnourished.\nBarium swallow establishes the diagnosis. Oesophago-\nscopy is required to exclude malignancy.\nTREATMENT\n1. prograde dilatation with bougies. It should be \ndone under direct vision through oesophagoscope.

Patient  \ncan be given a thread to swallow, which is recovered from \nthe  stomach,  and  prograde  or  retrograde  bouginage  can  \nbe done.\n3. surgery.  Excision  of  strictured  segment  and  recon-\nstruction  of  food  passage  using  stomach,  colon  or  jeju-\nnum.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nIt is displacement of stomach into the chest through oe-\nsophageal  opening  of  the  diaphragm.  Most  patients  are  \nelderly, past 40 years. This disorder is of two types:\n1. Sliding.  Stomach  is  pushed  into  the  thorax,  in  line  \nwith  the  oesophagus.  Reflux  oesophagitis  is  common  \nand may give rise to ulceration and stenosis. Haemate-\nmesis may occur. It is caused by raised intra-abdominal \npressure.\n2. Paraoesophageal. A part of the stomach along with its \nperitoneal  covering  passes  up  into  the  thorax  by  the  \nside  of  oesophagus.  The  gastro-oesophageal  junction  \nstill  remains  below  the  diaphragm  and  the  angle  be-\ntween  oesophagus  and  stomach  is  maintained.  There  \nis  no  reflux  oesophagitis  in  this  type  of  hernia.  The  \nmain  symptom  is  dyspnoea  on  exertion  due  to  posi-\ntion of stomach in the thorax and sometimes bleeding.\nDiagnosis of both types of hiatus hernia can be made \nby barium swallow.\nTREATMENT\nMainly it is surgical; the hernia is reduced and diaphrag-\nmatic  opening  repaired.  Early  cases  and  those  unfit  for  \nsurgery  may  be  treated  conservatively  to  reduce  reflux  \noesophagitis  by  measures  such  as  (i)  sleeping  with  head  \nand  chest  raised,  (ii)  avoidance  of  smoking,  (iii)  use  of  \ndrugs that reduce acidity (antacids and proton pump in-\nhibitors), (iv) reduction of obesity and (v) attention to the \ncauses which raises intra-abdominal pressure.\nPLUMMER–VINSON (PATTERSON–\nBROWN–KELLY) SYNDROME\nClassical  features  of  this  syndrome  include  dysphagia,  \niron-deficiency   anaemia,   glossitis,   angular   stomatitis,   \nkoilonychia (spooning of nails) and achlorhydria. There \nis  atrophy  of  the  mucous  membrane  of  the  alimentary  \ntract.\nPredominantly, it affects females past 40 years. Barium \nswallow  shows  a  web  in  the  postcricoid  region  and  the  \nsame can be seen on oesophagoscopy.

The symptoms consist of dysphagia or odynopha-\ngia with substernal chest pain, simulating angina pecto-\nris.  Barium  swallow  may  show  segmented  oesophageal  \nspasms giving a rosary bead or a cork-screw type of oesopha-\ngus, though it may be normal in some. Manometry shows \nnormal  relaxation  of  the  sphincter  on  swallowing.  The  \ntreatment  is  dilatation  of  lower  oesophagus.  Severe  cases  \nmay  require  myotomy  of  oesophagus  from  the  arch  of  \naorta to lower sphincter.\nNUT-CRACKER OESOPHAGUS\nThese  are  strong,  high  amplitude  oesophageal  contrac-\ntions  but  the  contractions  remain  peristaltic  (compare  \ndiffuse  oesophageal  spasm  where  contractions  are  non-\nperistaltic).

Forceful  pneumatic  dilatation  of  the  lower  \noesophagus can be done in those unfit for surgery.\nGASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL REFLUX\nIt  is  due  to  decreased  function  of  lower  oesophageal  \nsphincter  thus  permitting  regurgitation  of  gastric  con-\ntents into oesophagus. Other causes of gastro-oesophage-\nal reflux are pregnancy, hiatus hernia, scleroderma, exces-\nsive use of tobacco and alcohol, and drugs that relax the \nsmooth  muscle  (anticholinergic,  beta-adrenergic  drugs  \nand calcium-channel blockers).\nThe symptoms of oesophageal reflux include substernal \npain, heartburn and regurgitation.\nThe treatment consists of:\n1. Elevation of the head of bed at night.\n2. Avoiding food at least 3 h before bedtime.\n3.  Antacids.\n4. Drugs that increase tone of lower oesophageal sphinc-\nter, e.g. metoclopramide.\n5.

Manometry shows \nnormal  relaxation  of  the  sphincter  on  swallowing.  The  \ntreatment  is  dilatation  of  lower  oesophagus.  Severe  cases  \nmay  require  myotomy  of  oesophagus  from  the  arch  of  \naorta to lower sphincter.\nNUT-CRACKER OESOPHAGUS\nThese  are  strong,  high  amplitude  oesophageal  contrac-\ntions  but  the  contractions  remain  peristaltic  (compare  \ndiffuse  oesophageal  spasm  where  contractions  are  non-\nperistaltic). It causes dysphagia and substernal pain.\nCARDIAC ACHALASIA\nIt is characterized by the absence of peristalsis in the body \nof oesophagus and high resting pressure in lower oesoph-\nageal sphincter; the latter also does not relax during swal-\nlowing.\nThe symptoms  of  cardiac  achalasia  include  dysphagia,  \nwhich is more to liquids than solids (reverse of that seen",

It arises from the \nsmooth muscle and grows in the wall of oesophagus. Dys-\nphagia  is  produced  when  tumour  exceeds  the  diameter  \nof  5  cm.  Barium  swallow  shows  an  ovoid  filling  defect.  \nEndoscopy reveals a submucosal swelling. Biopsy should \nnot be taken. Treatment is enucleation of the tumour by \nthoracotomy.\nMucosal polyps, lipomas, fibromas and haemangio-\nmas are other benign tumours.

In India, high in-\ncidence is associated with tobacco chewing and smoking.\nAbout 5% of oesophageal cancers arise in the pre-exist-\ning pathological lesions, such as benign strictures, hiatus \nhernia,  cardiac  achalasia  and  diverticula.  Plummer–Vin-\nson syndrome is another predisposing factor.\nPathology\nSquamous  cell  carcinoma  is  the  most  common  (93%).  \nAdenocarcinoma  (3%)  is  also  seen,  but  in  the  lower  oe-\nsophagus, and may be an upward extension of the gastric \ncarcinoma. Other types are rare.\nSpread of Carcinoma\n1. Direct. The lesion may fill the lumen and infiltrate the \nwall of oesophagus. It may also spread to the adjoining \nstructures which are contact with the oesophagus such \nas the trachea, left bronchus, aorta or pericardium. In-\nvolvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerves causes as-\npiration problems.\n2. Lymphatic. Depending on the site involved, cervical, \nmediastinal  or  coeliac  nodes  may  be  involved.  Cervi-\ncal and thoracic lesions also spread to supraclavicular \nnodes.  “Skip  lesions”  may  also  occur  due  to  spread  \nthrough the submucosal lymphatics.\n3. Blood  borne.  Metastases  may  develop  in  the  liver,  \nlungs, bone and brain.\nClinical Features\n1. Early symptoms. They include substernal discomfort \nand preference for soft or liquid food.\n2. Progressive  dysphagia  and  emaciation.  Dysphagia  \nfirst to solids and then to liquids. Patient loses weight \nand becomes emaciated.\n3. Pain.  Usually  signifies  extension  of  tumour  beyond  \nthe walls of oesophagus. It is referred to the back.\n4. Aspiration  problem.  Spread  of  cancer  may  cause  la-\nryngeal   paralysis   or   fistulae   formation   leading   to   \ncough, hoarseness of voice, aspiration pneumonia and \nmediastinitis.\nDiagnosis\n1.

Useful  to  see  the  site  of  involve-\nment, extent of the lesion and to take biopsy.

      "content": "393\nChapter 69\nDysphagia\nDysphagia   is   difficulty   in   swallowing.   The   term   \nodynophagia is used when swallowing causes pain. The \nlatter  is  more  marked  in  ulcerative  and  inflammatory  \nlesions  of  food  passages-oral  cavity,  oropharynx  and  \noesophagus.\nAETIOLOGY\nThe cause of dysphagia may be preoesophageal (i.e. due to \ndisturbance in the oral or pharyngeal phase of deglutition), \nor oesophageal (when disturbance is in oesophageal phase). \nThis classification is clinically useful as most of the preoe-\nsophageal causes can be easily excluded by physical exami-\nnation while oesophageal ones require investigation.\nPREOESOPHAGEAL CAUSES\n1. oral  phase.  Normally,  food  must  be  masticated,  \nlubricated  with  saliva,  converted  into  a  bolus  by  move-\nments  of  tongue  and  then  pushed  into  the  pharynx  by  \nelevation of the tongue against the hard palate. Any dis-\nturbance in these events will cause dysphagia. Thus cause \nmay be:\n(a) Disturbance in mastication. Trismus, fractures of man-\ndible,  tumours  of  the  upper  or  lower  jaw  and  disor-\nders of temporomandibular joints.\n(b) Disturbance  in  lubrication.  Xerostomia  following  ra-\ndiotherapy, Mikulicz’s disease, Sjogren’s disease.\n(c) Disturbance in mobility of tongue. Paralysis of tongue, \npainful ulcers, tumours of tongue, lingual abscess, to-\ntal glossectomy.\n(d) Defects of palate. Cleft palate, oronasal fistula.\n(e) Lesions of buccal cavity and floor of mouth. Stomatitis, \nulcerative lesions, Ludwig’s angina.\n2. pharyngeal  phase.  For  a  normal  swallow,  food  \nshould  enter  the  pharynx  and  then  be  directed  towards  \noesophageal  opening.  All  unwanted  communications  \ninto  the  nasopharynx,  larynx,  oral  cavity  should  be  \nclosed. Disturbances in this phase can arise from:\n(a) Obstructive  lesions  of  pharynx,  e.g.  tumours  of  tonsil,  \nsoft palate, pharynx, base of tongue, supraglottic lar-\nynx, or even obstructive hypertrophic tonsils.\n(b) Inflammatory conditions, e.g. acute tonsillitis, periton-\nsillar  abscess,  retro  or  parapharyngeal  abscess,  acute  \nepiglottitis, oedema larynx.\n(c) Spasmodic conditions, e.g. tetanus, rabies.\n(d) Paralytic  conditions.  Paralysis  of  soft  palate  due  to  \ndiphtheria,  bulbar  palsy,  cerebrovascular  accidents.  \nThey cause regurgitation into the nose.\nParalysis  of  larynx,  lesions  of  vagus  and  bilateral  su-\nperior laryngeal nerves cause aspiration of food into the \nlarynx.\nOESOPHAGEAL CAUSES\nThe lesions may lie in the lumen, in the wall or outside \nthe wall of oesophagus.\n1. Lumen. Obstruction to lumen can occur in atresia, for-\neign body, strictures, benign or malignant tumours.\n2. Wall. It can be acute or chronic oesophagitis, or motil-\nity disorders. The latter are:\n(a)  Hypomotility  disorders,  e.g.  achalasia,  scleroder-\nma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n(b)    Hypermotility    disorders,    e.g.    cricopharyngeal    \nspasm, diffuse oesophageal spasm.\n3. Outside  the  wall.

        "393\nChapter 69\nDysphagia\nDysphagia   is   difficulty   in   swallowing.   The   term   \nodynophagia is used when swallowing causes pain. The \nlatter  is  more  marked  in  ulcerative  and  inflammatory  \nlesions  of  food  passages-oral  cavity,  oropharynx  and  \noesophagus.\nAETIOLOGY\nThe cause of dysphagia may be preoesophageal (i.e. due to \ndisturbance in the oral or pharyngeal phase of deglutition), \nor oesophageal (when disturbance is in oesophageal phase). \nThis classification is clinically useful as most of the preoe-\nsophageal causes can be easily excluded by physical exami-\nnation while oesophageal ones require investigation.\nPREOESOPHAGEAL CAUSES\n1. oral  phase.  Normally,  food  must  be  masticated,  \nlubricated  with  saliva,  converted  into  a  bolus  by  move-\nments  of  tongue  and  then  pushed  into  the  pharynx  by  \nelevation of the tongue against the hard palate. Any dis-\nturbance in these events will cause dysphagia. Thus cause \nmay be:",

Thus cause \nmay be:\n(a) Disturbance in mastication. Trismus, fractures of man-\ndible,  tumours  of  the  upper  or  lower  jaw  and  disor-\nders of temporomandibular joints.\n(b) Disturbance  in  lubrication.  Xerostomia  following  ra-\ndiotherapy, Mikulicz’s disease, Sjogren’s disease.\n(c) Disturbance in mobility of tongue. Paralysis of tongue, \npainful ulcers, tumours of tongue, lingual abscess, to-\ntal glossectomy.\n(d) Defects of palate. Cleft palate, oronasal fistula.\n(e) Lesions of buccal cavity and floor of mouth. Stomatitis, \nulcerative lesions, Ludwig’s angina.\n2. pharyngeal  phase.  For  a  normal  swallow,  food  \nshould  enter  the  pharynx  and  then  be  directed  towards  \noesophageal  opening.  All  unwanted  communications  \ninto  the  nasopharynx,  larynx,  oral  cavity  should  be",

Disturbances in this phase can arise from:\n(a) Obstructive  lesions  of  pharynx,  e.g.  tumours  of  tonsil,  \nsoft palate, pharynx, base of tongue, supraglottic lar-\nynx, or even obstructive hypertrophic tonsils.\n(b) Inflammatory conditions, e.g. acute tonsillitis, periton-\nsillar  abscess,  retro  or  parapharyngeal  abscess,  acute  \nepiglottitis, oedema larynx.\n(c) Spasmodic conditions, e.g. tetanus, rabies.\n(d) Paralytic  conditions.  Paralysis  of  soft  palate  due  to  \ndiphtheria,  bulbar  palsy,  cerebrovascular  accidents.  \nThey cause regurgitation into the nose.\nParalysis  of  larynx,  lesions  of  vagus  and  bilateral  su-\nperior laryngeal nerves cause aspiration of food into the \nlarynx.\nOESOPHAGEAL CAUSES\nThe lesions may lie in the lumen, in the wall or outside",

Obstruction to lumen can occur in atresia, for-\neign body, strictures, benign or malignant tumours.\n2. Wall. It can be acute or chronic oesophagitis, or motil-\nity disorders. The latter are:\n(a)  Hypomotility  disorders,  e.g.  achalasia,  scleroder-\nma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n(b)    Hypermotility    disorders,    e.g.    cricopharyngeal    \nspasm, diffuse oesophageal spasm.\n3.

Partial  obstruction  becomes  total  with  time  \ndue to oedema.\n4. Drooling of saliva. It is seen in cases of total obstruc-\ntion. Saliva may be aspirated causing pneumonitis.\n5. Respiratory distress. Impacted foreign body in the up-\nper  oesophagus  compresses  posterior  wall  of  trachea  \ncausing respiratory obstruction especially in children. \nLaryngeal oedema can develop.\n6. Substernal or epigastric pain. It may occur due to oe-\nsophageal spasm or incipient perforation.\n7. In  partial  obstruction,  patient  may  still  be  taking  \nnormal  food  with  little  or  no  discomfort  for  a  few  \ndays.  Even  X-rays  may  be  normal.  No  complacency  \nshould  be  observed  and  an  endoscopic  examination  \nperformed  when  history  and  physical  examination  \nstrongly suggest a foreign body.\nSIGNS\n1. Tenderness in the lower part of neck on the right or left \nof trachea.\n2. Pooling of secretions in the pyriform fossa on indirect \nlaryngoscopy. They do not disappear on swallowing.\n3.  Sometimes  a  foreign  body  may  be  seen  protruding  \nfrom  the  oesophageal  opening  in  the  postcricoid  \nregion.\nINVESTIGATIONS\nPosteroanterior  and  lateral  views  of  neck  and  similar  \nviews of the chest including abdomen are taken. They re-\nveal most of the radio-opaque foreign bodies and their lo-\ncation (Figures 70.1–70.3).

LASERS\nLASER is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated \nEmission of Radiation.\nprinciple. Normally, an atom is in a stable form, i.e. the \nelectrons, equal to the number of protons, are revolving \naround the nucleus in a fixed orbit. When given energy, \nelectrons change their orbits away from the nucleus and \nthe atoms are then called “excited” but this excited state \nof atoms does not last long. The atoms soon release their \nabsorbed  energy  automatically  (spontaneous  emission)  \nand return to their original state. If photons are made to \nstrike these excited atoms, the decay of the atoms is accel-\nerated  and  both  the  incident  and  the  absorbed  photons  \nare released (stimulated emission). This stimulated radia-\ntion  is  amplified  with  the  help  of  mirrors.  Thus,  lasers  \nare electromagnetic radiations. They have specific wave-\nlength, which depends upon the type of lasing medium \nsuch as argon, carbon dioxide, Nd:YAG, helium, etc.\nTYPES OF LASERS\nDepending  upon  the  lasing  medium,  various  types  of  \nlasers  with  differing  wavelength  can  be  created.  Lasing  \nmedium can be solid (ruby, Nd: YAG or potassium titanyl \nphosphate); gas (CO\n2\n or Helium–Neon) or liquid (pumped \ninorganic dye in a glass tube). Various types of lasers are \ngiven in Table 71.1.\nEFFECTS OF LASER ON TISSUES\nWhen  a  laser  hits  the  tissue  it  can  meet  the  following  \nfates (Figure 71.1):\n1. Reflection. Part or whole of laser light is reflected back.\n2. Absorption. Laser energy is absorbed by the tissue. It \nis  the  absorbed  energy  which  produces  its  effect  on  \ntissues.\n3. Scatter. Laser energy scatters in the tissues and its pen-\netration deep into the tissues becomes limited. Shorter \nthe wavelength, more of the energy is scattered.\n4. Transmission. The light is transmitted through the tissue \nwithout  causing  any  effect  on  tissues  through  which  it  \npassed. Argon laser has been used to coagulate retinal ves-\nsels without any damage to cornea, lens or the vitreous.\nLasers which are reflected or transmitted through the \ntissue do not cause any effect on tissues.\nEffect  of  laser  on  the  tissues  depends  on  the  absorbed  \nenergy. At a temperature of 60 °C, there is protein denatur-\nation but tissues can recover. At 80 °C there is degradation \nFigure 71.1. Effect of laser beam on tissue: (a) reflection, (b) transmission, (c) scatter and (d) absorption with tissue destruction.\nmebooksfree.com",

LASERS\nLASER is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated \nEmission of Radiation.\nprinciple. Normally, an atom is in a stable form, i.e. the \nelectrons, equal to the number of protons, are revolving \naround the nucleus in a fixed orbit. When given energy, \nelectrons change their orbits away from the nucleus and \nthe atoms are then called “excited” but this excited state \nof atoms does not last long. The atoms soon release their \nabsorbed  energy  automatically  (spontaneous  emission)  \nand return to their original state. If photons are made to \nstrike these excited atoms, the decay of the atoms is accel-\nerated  and  both  the  incident  and  the  absorbed  photons  \nare released (stimulated emission). This stimulated radia-\ntion  is  amplified  with  the  help  of  mirrors.  Thus,  lasers  \nare electromagnetic radiations. They have specific wave-",
        "are released (stimulated emission). This stimulated radia-\ntion  is  amplified  with  the  help  of  mirrors.  Thus,  lasers  \nare electromagnetic radiations. They have specific wave-\nlength, which depends upon the type of lasing medium \nsuch as argon, carbon dioxide, Nd:YAG, helium, etc.\nTYPES OF LASERS\nDepending  upon  the  lasing  medium,  various  types  of  \nlasers  with  differing  wavelength  can  be  created.  Lasing  \nmedium can be solid (ruby, Nd: YAG or potassium titanyl \nphosphate); gas (CO\n2\n or Helium–Neon) or liquid (pumped \ninorganic dye in a glass tube). Various types of lasers are \ngiven in Table 71.1.\nEFFECTS OF LASER ON TISSUES\nWhen  a  laser  hits  the  tissue  it  can  meet  the  following  \nfates (Figure 71.1):\n1. Reflection. Part or whole of laser light is reflected back.\n2. Absorption. Laser energy is absorbed by the tissue. It \nis  the  absorbed  energy  which  produces  its  effect  on  \ntissues.\n3. Scatter. Laser energy scatters in the tissues and its pen-",
        "2. Absorption. Laser energy is absorbed by the tissue. It \nis  the  absorbed  energy  which  produces  its  effect  on  \ntissues.\n3. Scatter. Laser energy scatters in the tissues and its pen-\netration deep into the tissues becomes limited. Shorter \nthe wavelength, more of the energy is scattered.\n4. Transmission. The light is transmitted through the tissue \nwithout  causing  any  effect  on  tissues  through  which  it  \npassed. Argon laser has been used to coagulate retinal ves-\nsels without any damage to cornea, lens or the vitreous.\nLasers which are reflected or transmitted through the \ntissue do not cause any effect on tissues.\nEffect  of  laser  on  the  tissues  depends  on  the  absorbed  \nenergy. At a temperature of 60 °C, there is protein denatur-\nation but tissues can recover. At 80 °C there is degradation \nFigure 71.1.

When a burn is created by la-\nser beam, it always causes some degree of collateral damage. \nZones of tissue damage can be divided into (Figure 71.2):\n1. Zone of vaporization.

It has a wavelength of 600–1000 nm. It can \nbe delivered by optical fibres. It is moderately absorbed by \nmelanin and haemoglobin. Diode lasers have been used \nin  turbinate  reduction,  laser-assisted  stapedectomy  and  \nmucosa-intact tonsillar ablation.\nSAFETY PRECAUTIONS IN THE USE OF LASER\nIt is important to observe safety precautions in the use of la-\nser as they can cause damage to eyes (retina, cornea or lens), \nskin and airways or cause endotracheal tube fires which can \nbe catastrophic. The measures to be taken include:\n1. Education  of  the  staff.  All  personnel  working  with  \nlasers, doctors, nurses and technical staff of the opera-\ntion theatre should be educated about the safe use of \nlasers and their hazards.\n2. Protection of eyes and skin. All the staff working in \nthe  operation  theatre  should  use  wavelength-specific  \nglasses.  Glasses  should  also  have  side  protectors  to  \navoid  damage  by  any  reflected  rays.  Plain  glasses  for  \nCO\n2\n laser, blue–green for Nd: YAG and amber coloured \nfor  Argon  laser  are  used.  Wavelength-specific  glasses  \nare  available  with  all  the  lasers.  Lasers  with  visible  or  \nnear-infrared range of electromagnetic spectrum (400–\n1400  nm)  damage  the  retina  and  those  with  ranges  \nless than 400 nm and more than 1400 nm damage the \ncornea  and  sometimes  even  the  lens  causing  corneal  \nopacities or cataracts. Patient’s eye should be protected \nby  double  layer  of  saline-soaked  cotton  eye  pads.  All  \nother  exposed  parts  of  face  should  be  covered  by  sa-\nline-soaked wet towels.\n3. Endotracheal   tubes.   Wavelength-specific   endotra-\ncheal tubes are available. Rubber tubes are better than \nPVC  ones;  the  latter  are  less  resistant  to  laser  beam  \nand also produce more damage if accidental fires take \nplace;  also  their  breakdown  products  are  more  toxic.  \nTubes can be wrapped with reflective aluminium foils \nto avoid burns. Colourless or silicon tubes can be used \nwith Nd: YAG laser but they should not have any black \nor dark lettering or a lead-lined marking along the side.\n4. Anaesthetic  gases.  Halothane  or  enflurane  are  used  \nas they are noninflammable. Nitrous oxide gas, being \noxidizing, is not used.\n5. Evacuation  of  smoke.  In  addition  to  suction  tube  \nbeing  used  by  the  surgeon  to  aspirate  blood  and  se-\ncretions,  another  suction  tube  should  be  available  to  \nremove  smoke  and  steam  created  by  vaporization  of  \ntissues.  It  should  not  spread  into  the  OT  and  be  in-\nhaled  by  OT  staff.  Smoke  may  be  mutagenic  and  has  \nalso been shown to contain virus particles from tissue \nvaporization of viral papillomas.\n6. Tube fires. This is a dreaded complication and several \ncases are on record. In case of tube fire, stop ventilation \nimmediately, pour saline with a syringe and withdraw \nthe tube simultaneously. Re-establish the airway with a \nnew endotracheal tube. Perform a bronchoscopy to as-\nsess the degree of damage to the tracheobronchial tube \nand give intravenous steroids. Carefully follow the pa-\ntient postoperatively with repeat bronchoscopies.\nPRECAUTIONS IN THE USE OF LASERS\n1. Display a sign outside OT “Lasers In Use.”\n2. Close the OT door. No entry or exit of staff permitted.\n3. Protective glasses, specific for the wavelength of laser, \nbeing used should be worn by the surgeon, nurses and \nother  OT  personnel.

Do not use N\n2\nO.\n9.  Keep  a  bowl  and  a  syringe  filled  with  saline  in  readi-\nness in case of tube fires.\nB. PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY\nIt  is  an  upcoming  newer  modality  of  treating  cancer  of  \nskin, larynx, nasopharynx, tumours of aerodigestive tract \nand endobronchial tumours. It is based on the principle \nof  injecting  a  photosensitizing  agent  which  is  taken  up  \npreferentially by the tumour cells and then exposing the \nsite to a specific wavelength of the laser. Laser activates the \nphotosensitizing agent which brings about destruction of \ncancer cells but spares the normal tissues. Photodynamic \ntherapy has also been used for recurrences after surgery, \nradiation or chemotherapy. Photosensitizing agents used \nintravenously  include  haematoporphyrin  derivative  (for  \nhead  and  neck  cancers)  and  photosan-3  (for  endobron-\nchial  tumours).  Topical  sensitizer,  delta  aminolevulinic  \nacid, has been used for skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma \nand Bowen disease).\nLaser  often  used  in  photodynamic  therapy  is  argon  \ntunable dye laser with a wavelength of 630 nm. It also has \nthe advantage of delivery through flexible fibres. Also, by \nchanging  the  dye,  lasers  with  different  wavelengths  can  \nbe  produced.  Patients  receiving  photodynamic  therapy  \nshould avoid exposure to sunlight and use sun-protective \nclothing  to  avoid  photosensitive  skin  reactions  which  \nmay continue for several weeks.\nII. RADIOFREQUENCY SURGERY IN ENT\nRadiowaves have been used surgically to reduce the vol-\nume of tissues. It has been used on inferior turbinates to \nrelieve nasal obstruction; on soft palate to relieve primary \nsnoring,  upper  airway  resistance  and  sleep  apnoea;  and  \non the base of tongue to relieve sleep apnoea. It has also \nbeen used for the treatment of lingual thyroid.\nThe  radiofrequency  (RF)  device  generates  electromag-\nnetic waves of very high frequency between 350 kHz and \n4 MHz. Usually 460 kHz is used. RF is delivered through \nvarious  probes  according  to  the  site  of  ablation.  The  \nprobe,  inserted  into  the  tissues,  causes  ionic  agitation,  \nheats  up  the  tissues  which  result  in  protein  coagulation  \nand tissue necrosis but no charring. Later scar formation \noccurs  in  3  weeks  with  reduction  in  size  of  tissue.  Usu-\nally the temperature is controlled between 80 and 85 °C. \nThe essential parameters of radiofrequency are the power \n(in  Watts),  temperature  (degrees  of  Celsius),  resistance  \n(in Ohms), treatment time (in seconds) and total energy \ndelivered in joules (i.e. Watt × seconds); they can all be \ncontrolled in the device.\nUsing different types of electrodes, radiofrequency has \nalso  been  used  to  perform  tonsillotomy,  microlaryngeal  \nsurgery  (to  remove  granulomas,  papillomas,  cysts),  my-\nringotomy, uvulopalatoplasty, correction of rhinophyma \nand cosmetic removal of skin lesions. Radiofrequency is \nused to cut and coagulate tissues with minimal lateral tis-\nsue damage and charring. It is a minimally invasive tech-\nnique  and  surgery  can  be  performed  as  an  outdoor  pro-\ncedure.  Complications  are  few.  The  procedures  are  cost  \neffective.\nIII. HYPERBARIC OXYGEN \nTHERAPY IN ENT\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a treatment modal-\nity  involving  the  intermittent  inhalation  of  100%  oxy-\ngen  in  chambers  pressurized  above  1  atmosphere  abso-\nlute (ATA). ATA is the unit of pressure and 1 ATA is equal \nto 760 mm of mercury or pressure at sea level. When all \npressures  to  which  a  person  is  exposed  are  summed  up,  \nthe result is called atmospheres absolute. (Committee on \nHyperbaric  Medicine,  Undersea  &  Hyperbaric  Medicine  \nSociety 1976).\nHBOT has been used as an adjunctive therapy for sud-\nden  sensorineural  hearing  loss  (SSNHL)  as  it  raises  the  \namount  of  oxygen  in  the  inner  ear  by  diffusion,  which  \nactivates  cell  metabolism  leading  to  restoration  of  ionic  \nbalance and electrophysiological functions of cochlea.\nDue  of  lack  of  definite  cause  of  SSNHL,  its  treatment  \nis largely empirical and includes use of a wide variety of \ntherapies like systemic and intratympanic steroids, vaso-\ndilators,  antiviral  and  anticoagulants  to  counteract  pos-\nsible  inflammatory  mechanism  modifying  hydrostatic  \npressure and improving cochlear blood flow. The possible \nfinal goal of any treatment modality of SSNHL is the res-\ntoration  of  oxygen  tension  in  the  cochlea  to  encourage  \nhealing and return of hearing to normal levels.\nThe high spontaneous recovery rate of SSNHL and its \nlow  incidence  make  validation  of  empirical  treatment  \nmodalities  difficult.  HBOT  in  recent  years  has  gained  \nrelevance for treating SSNHL in combination with other \nagents. The Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine Society (UHMS) \nafter a review of data available across the world has approved \nthe use of HBOT in SSNHL in October 2011.\nINDICATIONS FOR HBOT\nOver the last two decades, animal studies and clinical tri-\nals have produced reasonable scientific evidence or well-\nvalidated clinical experience. This has led to a renaissance \nof HBO and produced a set of indications for which HBO \nis beneficial (Figure 71.4).\nEvidence-based Indications \n(Approved by UHMS)\n1. Healing in problem wounds, diabetic or venous\n2.  Necrotizing  soft  tissue  damage  including  malignant  \notitis externa\n3. Radiation tissue damage\n4. Carbon monoxide poisoning\n5.

HYPERBARIC OXYGEN \nTHERAPY IN ENT\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a treatment modal-\nity  involving  the  intermittent  inhalation  of  100%  oxy-\ngen  in  chambers  pressurized  above  1  atmosphere  abso-\nlute (ATA). ATA is the unit of pressure and 1 ATA is equal \nto 760 mm of mercury or pressure at sea level. When all \npressures  to  which  a  person  is  exposed  are  summed  up,",

When all \npressures  to  which  a  person  is  exposed  are  summed  up,  \nthe result is called atmospheres absolute. (Committee on \nHyperbaric  Medicine,  Undersea  &  Hyperbaric  Medicine  \nSociety 1976).\nHBOT has been used as an adjunctive therapy for sud-\nden  sensorineural  hearing  loss  (SSNHL)  as  it  raises  the  \namount  of  oxygen  in  the  inner  ear  by  diffusion,  which  \nactivates  cell  metabolism  leading  to  restoration  of  ionic  \nbalance and electrophysiological functions of cochlea.\nDue  of  lack  of  definite  cause  of  SSNHL,  its  treatment  \nis largely empirical and includes use of a wide variety of \ntherapies like systemic and intratympanic steroids, vaso-\ndilators,  antiviral  and  anticoagulants  to  counteract  pos-\nsible  inflammatory  mechanism  modifying  hydrostatic  \npressure and improving cochlear blood flow.

        "dilators,  antiviral  and  anticoagulants  to  counteract  pos-\nsible  inflammatory  mechanism  modifying  hydrostatic  \npressure and improving cochlear blood flow. The possible \nfinal goal of any treatment modality of SSNHL is the res-\ntoration  of  oxygen  tension  in  the  cochlea  to  encourage  \nhealing and return of hearing to normal levels.\nThe high spontaneous recovery rate of SSNHL and its \nlow  incidence  make  validation  of  empirical  treatment  \nmodalities  difficult.  HBOT  in  recent  years  has  gained  \nrelevance for treating SSNHL in combination with other \nagents. The Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine Society (UHMS) \nafter a review of data available across the world has approved \nthe use of HBOT in SSNHL in October 2011.\nINDICATIONS FOR HBOT\nOver the last two decades, animal studies and clinical tri-\nals have produced reasonable scientific evidence or well-\nvalidated clinical experience.

Cryotherapy  has  been  \nfound useful to treat haemangiomas involving skin, oral \ncavity or oropharynx. It has also been used as an adjunct \nto treat vascular tumours such as angiofibroma and glo-\nmus tumour.\n2.  premalignant  lesions.  Leukoplakia,  involving  the  \ncheek, tongue, floor of mouth, has been effectively treat-\ned by cryotherapy. It is preferred to electrosurgery because \nof  less  scarring,  better  quality  of  regenerated  epithelium  \nand no recurrence of lesion. It is also used to treat solar \nkeratosis, a precancerous condition of skin.\n3.  malignant  lesions.  Skin  cancers  like  Bowen  dis-\nease  (intraepithelial  carcinoma)  and  basal  cell  carcinoma  \nhave been treated successfully with a cure rate of 94–97%. \nCryotherapy  is  particularly  useful  when  tumour  overlies  \nthe  cartilage  as  the  latter  does  not  undergo  necrosis  with  \nfreezing. It is also useful for skin cancers which are multi-\nple.  Recurrent  skin  cancers  or  lesions  which  do  not  have  \nwell-defined margins should not be treated by this method.\nMajor  role  of  cryotherapy  has  been  in  the  palliation  \nof advanced cancers or recurrent or residual tumours. In \nthese cases, aim is to debulk the tumour mass to facilitate \ndeglutition or respiration, to reduce tendency of tumours \nto bleed and to relieve pain.\nRole of curative cryotherapy in primary malignant le-\nsion of the oral cavity and oropharynx is limited though \nsome success is reported in early lesions (T\n1\n N\n0\n) involving \nfloor of mouth, tongue and palate. For this, cryotherapy \nshould be used very selectively, in patients who are other-\nwise high-risk groups and have a short expectancy of life \ndue to other concurrent disease.\n4.  other  uses.  Cryotherapy  has  been  applied  to  nasal  \nturbinates  to  reduce  their  size  and  improve  the  airway.  \nIt has also been used in allergic rhinitis to control sneez-\ning and rhinorrhoea.

      "content": "Chapter 73 — Radiotherapy in Head and Neck Cancers\n413\nHypoxic Cell Sensitisers\nNimorazole and tirapazamine are hypoxic cell sensitisers. \nThey have been used in concomitant chemotherapy.\nChemotherapeutic Drugs\nDrugs  such  as  cisplatin,  mitomycin-C,  5-fluorouracil,  \npacititaxel, docetaxel and hydroxyurea have been used in \nconcomitant chemoradiation. They act as radiosensitisers \nand potentiate the effect of radiation by their additive or \nsynergistic effect.\nCetuximab   is   a   monoclonal   antibody   which   acts   \nagainst  the  receptors  of  epidermal  growth  factor.  As  the  \nlatter  is  overexpressed  in  head  and  neck  cancers,  use  of  \ncetuximab would inhibit the receptors by blocking them. \nCetuximab  has  been  used  as  a  targeted  chemotherapy  \nalong with radiation.\nRADIOPROTECTORS\nThese  compounds  are  designed  to  reduce  damage  to  the  \nnormal  tissues  by  scavenging  highly  reactive  free  radicals  \ncaused by radiation. The most commonly used radioprotec-\ntors  are  amifostine,  antioxidants  (such  as  glutathione  and  \nvitamin A, C and E), lipoic acid and drugs such as cysteine.\nRadiation Fractionation\nConventional  radiotherapy  involves  delivering  2  Gy/\nday  for  5  days  in  a  week.  It  comes  to  5  fractions,  i.e.    \n1000 Gy in a week.\nHyperfractionation is delivering multiple daily doses \nof such a size that the overall treatment time is about the \nsame as in conventional radiotherapy. Dose of each frac-\ntion is reduced typically to a dose 1.1–1.2 Gy/fraction, 2 \nfractions/day are given. A total dose of 74–80 Gy can be \nused.  The  studies  conducted  on  hyperfraction  gave  bet-\nter locoregional control of disease and decreased delayed \nside  effects.  However,  acute  toxicity  was  significantly  \nmore.\nAccelerated  fractionation  uses  multiple  daily  radiation  \nfractions, and dose of each fraction is also increased. Thus \nthe total treatment time is reduced to give the total dose. \nHowever with this schedule incidence of severe late side \neffects  increased,  and  survival  of  patient  decreased  and  \nthis was attributed to these complications.\nINDICATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY \nIN HEAD AND NECK CANCER\nDEFINITIVE RADIOTHERAPY\nThe  aim  is  organ  preservation  with  radiation  only.

They act as radiosensitisers \nand potentiate the effect of radiation by their additive or \nsynergistic effect.\nCetuximab   is   a   monoclonal   antibody   which   acts   \nagainst  the  receptors  of  epidermal  growth  factor.  As  the  \nlatter  is  overexpressed  in  head  and  neck  cancers,  use  of  \ncetuximab would inhibit the receptors by blocking them. \nCetuximab  has  been  used  as  a  targeted  chemotherapy  \nalong with radiation.\nRADIOPROTECTORS\nThese  compounds  are  designed  to  reduce  damage  to  the  \nnormal  tissues  by  scavenging  highly  reactive  free  radicals",

The most commonly used radioprotec-\ntors  are  amifostine,  antioxidants  (such  as  glutathione  and  \nvitamin A, C and E), lipoic acid and drugs such as cysteine.\nRadiation Fractionation\nConventional  radiotherapy  involves  delivering  2  Gy/\nday  for  5  days  in  a  week.  It  comes  to  5  fractions,  i.e.    \n1000 Gy in a week.\nHyperfractionation is delivering multiple daily doses \nof such a size that the overall treatment time is about the \nsame as in conventional radiotherapy. Dose of each frac-\ntion is reduced typically to a dose 1.1–1.2 Gy/fraction, 2 \nfractions/day are given. A total dose of 74–80 Gy can be \nused.

However,  acute  toxicity  was  significantly  \nmore.\nAccelerated  fractionation  uses  multiple  daily  radiation  \nfractions, and dose of each fraction is also increased. Thus \nthe total treatment time is reduced to give the total dose. \nHowever with this schedule incidence of severe late side \neffects  increased,  and  survival  of  patient  decreased  and  \nthis was attributed to these complications.\nINDICATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY \nIN HEAD AND NECK CANCER\nDEFINITIVE RADIOTHERAPY\nThe  aim  is  organ  preservation  with  radiation  only.

It \ndepends  on  the  dose  and  schedule  of  radiotherapy  and  \naccompanying chemotherapy. Late toxicity is due to late-\nresponding  tissues  such  as  spinal  cord,  brain  cells  and  \nconnective tissues. It correlates with total dose and dose \nper fraction.\nTable  73.2  lists  acute  and  delayed  toxicities  of  radio-\ntherapy.\nCARE OF PATIENT DURING \nRADIOTHERAPY\nCARE OF SKIN\nSide  effects  can  be  minimized  by  proper  care  such  as  \navoidance  of  exposure  to  sun,  chemical  irritants,  and  \napplication  of  lotions  and  ointments  (except  those  \n  prescribed  by  the  radiotherapist).  Do  not  rub  or  scrub  \nthe skin.\nCARE OF ORAL CAVITY AND DENTITION\nXerostomia and mucositis are the main problems. Dental \ncaries  follow  xerostomia.  Mucositis  is  painful  and  inter-\nferes with food intake and nutrition.\nOral   hygiene   can   be   maintained   by   rinsing   the   \nmouth  and  gargling  several  times  a  day.  Use  only  non- \nalcoholbased gargles. Salt and sodium bicarbonate gargles \nhelp  to  clean  the  thick  saliva  and  mucus.  Mild  antisep-\ntic  lotion  can  be  used.  Mucositis  is  managed  by  dietary  \nmodification and topical anaesthetics.\nUse  of  a  soft  brush  and  application  of  a  fluoride  gel  \nprevents  tooth  decay.  Pre-irradiation  extraction  of  loose  \nand carious teeth is recommended to prevent osteoradi-\nonecrosis.\nCARE OF HAEMOPOETIC SYSTEM\nPatients undergo weekly haemograms to check for white \ncells,  haemoglobin  level  and  platelet  counts.  Corrective  \nmeasures are taken if counts fall. A good level of haemo-\nglobin  is  useful  to  carry  oxygen  to  the  target  area  for  a  \nbetter effect of radiation.\nCARE OF INFECTIONS\nPatients undergoing radiotherapy are immunosuppressed \nand may require treatment for concurrent infections. An-\ntibiotic, antifungal or antiviral drugs may be needed.\nCARE OF NUTRITION\nPatients are advised to consume a high-protein diet with \nvitamins  and  minerals.  Good  hydration  with  plenty  of  \nfluids and electrolytes should be maintained.\nBlended liquid or semisolid diet can be used in patients \nwith  odynophagia  or  dysphagia.  Sometimes  Ryles  tube  \nfeeding or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy may be \nneeded  to  maintain  nutrition.  Diet  should  incorporate  \niron, calcium and vitamin supplements.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL \nCOUNSELING\nPsychological counselling may be required from time to \ntime  during  or  after  radiotherapy  to  counter  depression  \ndue to prolonged illness and complications.\nHOSPITAL ADMISSION\nHospital  admission  may  be  required  in  cases  of  severe  \ninfection,  nutritional  deprivation,  supportive  treatment  \nand  for  respiratory,  vascular  or  neurological  complica-\ntions following acute or delayed effects of radiation.\nTABLE 73.2   COMPLICATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY\nEarlyLate\n1.

        "SECTION VIII — Recent Advances\n418\nSIDE EFFECTS OF RADIATION\nAcute toxicity is due to effect of radiation on rapidly di-\nviding tissues such as skin, mucosa and bone marrow. It \ndepends  on  the  dose  and  schedule  of  radiotherapy  and  \naccompanying chemotherapy. Late toxicity is due to late-\nresponding  tissues  such  as  spinal  cord,  brain  cells  and  \nconnective tissues. It correlates with total dose and dose \nper fraction.\nTable  73.2  lists  acute  and  delayed  toxicities  of  radio-\ntherapy.\nCARE OF PATIENT DURING \nRADIOTHERAPY\nCARE OF SKIN\nSide  effects  can  be  minimized  by  proper  care  such  as  \navoidance  of  exposure  to  sun,  chemical  irritants,  and  \napplication  of  lotions  and  ointments  (except  those  \n  prescribed  by  the  radiotherapist).  Do  not  rub  or  scrub  \nthe skin.\nCARE OF ORAL CAVITY AND DENTITION\nXerostomia and mucositis are the main problems. Dental \ncaries  follow  xerostomia.  Mucositis  is  painful  and  inter-",

Mucositis  is  painful  and  inter-\nferes with food intake and nutrition.\nOral   hygiene   can   be   maintained   by   rinsing   the   \nmouth  and  gargling  several  times  a  day.  Use  only  non- \nalcoholbased gargles. Salt and sodium bicarbonate gargles \nhelp  to  clean  the  thick  saliva  and  mucus.  Mild  antisep-\ntic  lotion  can  be  used.  Mucositis  is  managed  by  dietary  \nmodification and topical anaesthetics.\nUse  of  a  soft  brush  and  application  of  a  fluoride  gel  \nprevents  tooth  decay.  Pre-irradiation  extraction  of  loose  \nand carious teeth is recommended to prevent osteoradi-\nonecrosis.\nCARE OF HAEMOPOETIC SYSTEM\nPatients undergo weekly haemograms to check for white \ncells,  haemoglobin  level  and  platelet  counts.

A good level of haemo-\nglobin  is  useful  to  carry  oxygen  to  the  target  area  for  a  \nbetter effect of radiation.\nCARE OF INFECTIONS\nPatients undergoing radiotherapy are immunosuppressed \nand may require treatment for concurrent infections. An-\ntibiotic, antifungal or antiviral drugs may be needed.\nCARE OF NUTRITION\nPatients are advised to consume a high-protein diet with \nvitamins  and  minerals.  Good  hydration  with  plenty  of  \nfluids and electrolytes should be maintained.\nBlended liquid or semisolid diet can be used in patients \nwith  odynophagia  or  dysphagia.

All  types  of  infection  can  \noccur: viral, bacterial, protozoal, mycobacterial or fun-\ngal. They can involve any area of ear, nose and throat, \nhead and neck, and central nervous system.\n2. Unusual malignancies. Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and lym-\nphomas  are  common.  KS  can  involve  skin,  mucous  \nmembranes  or  viscera.  KS  may  be  seen  in  the  skin  of  \nface (nose, ear or external ear canal), neck or extremi-\nties.  It  can  also  occur  in  oral,  nasal,  nasopharyngeal,  \noropharyngeal or laryngeal mucosa.

It  could  be  only  a  follicular  hyper-\nplasia  or  due  to  a  disease  such  as  tuberculosis,  histo-\nplasmosis, toxoplasmosis or non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin \nlymphoma.\nKAPOSI SARCOMA\nIt is a multicentric neoplasm which may involve any part \nof the skin, mucosa or the viscera. There is excessive pro-\nliferation of spindle cells of vascular origin. It is noninva-\nsive and respects the fascial planes. In the oral cavity, Ka-\nposi sarcoma is mostly seen in the palate, but may occur \non the tongue or gingiva or on the posterior wall of the \npharynx. It appears purplish in colour and may need to \nbe  differentiated  from  angioma  or  pyogenic  granuloma.  \nIt can occur at any stage of HIV infection, even in those \nwith  normal  CD4  counts.  Size  of  the  tumour  may  vary  \nfrom a few mm to several centimetres. Diagnosis is based \non biopsy which may show proliferation of spindle cells, \nendothelial  cells,  extravasation  of  red  blood  cells  and  \nhaemosiderin-laden   macrophages.   Treatment   includes   \nlocalized radiation, intralesional vinblastine or cryother-\napy. Systemic chemotherapy may be given in those with \nmultiple lesions.\nNON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA\nHIV  patients  have  high  incidence  of  lymphomas.  B-cell  \nlymphomas are more common (90%) and many are due \nto  Epstein–Barr  virus.  Risk  of  lymphomas  increases  as  \ndisease progresses generally in patient with CD4+ count \nless than 200/mm\n3\n. CNS lymphomas occur in late stages \nof the disease while systemic ones can occur early. Both \nnodal and extranodal sites can be involved; the latter in-\nclude  nose  and  paranasal  sinuses,  tonsils,  nasopharynx,  \ntongue, orbit and larynx. They also involve gastrointesti-\nnal tract, lung and bone marrow. Cervical lymphadenop-\nathy can occur.\nHodgkin lymphoma is less common.\nHAIRY LEUKOPLAKIA\nIt is a white, vertically corrugated lesions on the anterior \npart of the lateral border of tongue. It is probably caused \nby Epstein–Barr virus. It develops early and gives clue to \nHIV infection. AIDS develops in 50% of such patients in \n16  months  or  80%  in  30  months.  Differential  diagnosis  \nincludes  leukoplakia,  carcinoma  in  situ,  hypertrophic  \ncandidiasis  or  lichen  planus.  Biopsy  should  be  done  to  \nconfirm.\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTS\nDiagnostic tests are based on identification of antibodies \nor viral antigens. Antibodies are formed within 3 months \n(2 weeks–12 weeks) of infection.\n1. ELISA  test  (enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay). \nIt is a very sensitive test (sensitivity more than 95.5%).\n2. Western blot. It is a confirmatory test and specific for \nHIV antibodies.\n3. CD4  count.  Normal  count  is  600–1500/mm\n3\n.  De-\ncreasing  counts  indicate  immune  compromise  and  \nthe  corresponding  risk  for  development  of  opportun-\nistic  infections  and  malignancies.  Disease  has  been  \nclassified according to CD4 counts such as (i) less than \n500 cells/mm\n3\n; (ii) 200–499 cells/mm\n3\n or (iii) less than  \n200  cells/mm\n3\n;  AIDS-defining  illnesses  appear  when  \nCD4 count fall below 200/mm\n3\n.\n4. p24 antigen assay. It detects p24 core protein of HIV. \nThe test is positive even prior to seroconversion. High \nlevels  of  p24  antigen  are  present  before  development  \nof antibodies and are useful in those suspected of acute \nHIV syndrome.\n5. PCR  tests.  They  determine  HIV-RNA.  Two  important  \ntests are reverse transcriptase PCR and branched DNA \nassay.  They  determine  number  of  copies  of  RNA  per  \nmillilitre of plasma and indicate viral load.\nHIV INFECTION AND HEALTHCARE \nWORKERS\nDoctors, particularly the surgeons, nurses and laboratory \nstaff  handling  the  blood,  blood-stained  body  fluids  and  \nother secretions may contract the disease as occupation-\nal  hazard.  They  should  follow  the  universal  precautions  \n(vide infra) considering that every sample they handle is \npotentially infected. The risk is due to:\n1. Needle-stick injury. Hollow needle (e.g. injection nee-\ndle)  is  more  dangerous  than  solid  needle  (e.g.  suture  \nneedle). The risk is. 0.3%, i.e. (1:300).\nmebooksfree.com",

A student is expect-\ned to learn this by regular practice in ENT clinics.\nEQUIPMENT FOR ENT EXAMINATION \n(FIGURE 76.1)\nThe requirements of equipment in a clinic may vary but \nthe  essential  instruments  for  routine  examination  are  \nlisted here.\n1. Bull’s  eye  lamp.  It  provides  a  powerful  source  of  \nlight. The lamp can be tilted, rotated, raised or low-\nered according to the needs (Figure 76.1).\n2. Head  mirror.  It  is  a  concave  mirror  used  to  reflect  \nlight from the Bull’s eye lamp onto the part being ex-\namined. It has a focal length of approximately 25 cm. \nThe examiner sees through the hole in the centre of \nthe  mirror.  Diameter  of  the  mirror  is  89  mm  (3½“)  \nand that of the central hole is 19 mm (3/4”).\nSources  of  illumination  include  electric  headlights  \nconnected  to  a  main  power  source  through  a  step-\ndown transformer or chargeable batteries (Figure 76.2). \nThe latter have the advantage for bedside examination.\n3. Tongue  depressors.  Different  sizes  for  children  and  \nadults should be available. It is used in the examina-\ntion of oral cavity and oropharynx.\n4. Nasal specula. Two types are commonly used, name-\nly Thudicum and Vienna types. The size of the nasal \nspeculum is selected according to the age of the pa-\ntient and size of the nostril.\n5. Laryngeal  mirrors.  They  are  used  to  examine  the  \nlarynx and laryngopharynx. Various sizes, from 6 to \n30 mm diameter, are available. To prevent fogging, a \nmirror is always warmed over a spirit lamp or by dip-\nping  it  in  hot  water  and  then  tested  on  the  back  of  \nhand before insertion into the mouth.\n6. Postnasal mirror. It is used to examine the nasophar-\nynx and posterior part of nasal cavity. Like laryngeal \nmirror,  it  is  also  warmed  and  tested  on  the  back  of  \nhand before use.\n7. Ear specula. Various sizes are available to suit differ-\nent sizes of the ear canal. The largest speculum which \ncan be conveniently inserted in the ear canal should \nbe used.\n8. Siegle’s speculum. Essential in examination of tym-\npanic membrane; it gives magnified view of  tympanic \nmembrane  and  helps  to  test  its  mobility.  It  is  also  \nused to elicit the fistula sign.\n9. Tuning forks. Commonly used tuning fork has a fre-\nquency of 512 Hz. Forks of other frequencies, e.g. 256 \nand 1024 Hz should also be available.\n10. Jobson–Horne’s probe. One end of the probe is used \nto form a cotton bud to clean the ear of discharge and \nthe  other  end  (with  ring  curette)  is  used  to  remove  \nthe wax.\n11. Blunt probe. It is used for palpation in the nasal cav-\nity or ear canal.\n12. Tilley’s or Hartman’s forceps. It is used in packing of \near canal or nasal cavity.\n13. Eustachian  catheter.  It  is  used  to  test  patency  of  \nthe eustachian tube and can also be used to remove \nforeign  bodies  from  the  nose.  To  test  the  patency  \nof  eustachian  tube,  the  nose  is  first  anaesthetized,  \nthe catheter is then passed along the floor of nose \ninto  the  nasopharynx,  turned  medially  and  then  \nslightly  withdrawn  till  it  engages  on  the  posterior  \nfree border of the nasal septum. At this point, it is \nrotated 180° laterally to lie against the opening of \neustachian  tube.  A  bulb  is  attached  and  air  insuf-\nflated.  If  the  tube  is  patent,  air  enters  the  middle  \near  and  can  be  detected  by  an  auscultation  tube  \nwhich  connects  patient’s  ear  to  that  of  the  exam-\niner (see p. 63).\n14. Otoscope. It is an electric or battery operated device \nwith a magnifying glass. Sometimes it has an arrange-\nment  to  attach  a  bulb  to  function  as  Siegel’s  specu-\nlum. It is useful for detailed examination of the ear. \nIt is an essential instrument to examine the ear of an \ninfant, a child or a bedridden patient.\n15. Spirit lamp.

Swelling around the ear.\nThe  details  of  history  of  these  symptoms  particularly  \nin reference to the onset, duration, progression and severity \nshould be noted.\nEXAMINATION\nIt includes both physical and functional examination.\nA. Physical Examination\nIt includes examination of:\n1. Pinna and the surrounding area.\n2. External auditory canal\n(a) Without speculum\n(b) With speculum\n3. Tympanic membrane.\n4. Middle ear.\n5.  Mastoid.\n6. Eustachian tube.\n7. Facial nerve and other cranial nerves.\n1. pinna and the surrounding area. The pinna is ex-\namined by inspection and palpation. Both of its surfaces, \nthe lateral and the medial, should be examined.\nLook for size (microtia, macrotia); shape (abnormalities \nof  contour,  cauliflower  ear);  position  (bat  ear).  Also  look  \nfor redness (furuncle or abscess); swelling (haematoma, ab-\nscess); vesicles  in  concha  and  retroauricular  groove  (herpes  \nzoster); scars (trauma or operation); ulceration or neoplasm.\nAlso examine the area above, in front, below and be-\nhind the pinna and look for a swelling (mastoid or zygo-\nmatic  abscess,  neoplasm  or  lymph  nodes);  sinus  (preau-\nricular  sinus);  fistula  (mastoid  fistula)  scar  (endaural  or  \npostaural scar due to previous operation).\nPalpation  of  pinna  is  essential  to  look  for  raised  tem-\nperature  (perichondritis  or  abscess);  thickness  of  tissues \n(perichondritis); fluctuation  (seroma  or  abscess)  and  ten-\nderness. Movement of pinna is painful in furunculosis of \nthe external canal.\n2. Examination oF external auditory canal\n(a)  Examination  without  a  speculum.  This  is  an  im-\nportant part of the examination and precedes in-\ntroduction  of  speculum.  The  pinna  is  pulled  up-\nwards  and  backwards  while  the  tragus  is  pulled  \nforwards to spread open the meatus. Look for the \nsize of meatus (narrow or wide), contents of lumen \n(wax, debris, discharge or polyp) or swelling of its \nwall (furuncle, neoplasm).\n(b)  Examination  with  a  speculum.  Once  the  size  of  \nthe  meatus  is  known,  proper  speculum  is  select-\ned  and  introduced  (Figure  76.4).  Use  the  largest  \nspeculum that can easily enter the canal. Look for \nwax,  debris,  discharge,  polyp,  granulations,  exos-\ntosis,  benign  or  malignant  neoplasm,  sagging  of  \nposterosuperior area (coalescent mastoiditis).\n3. examination oF  tympanic  membrane. Normal \ntympanic membrane is pearly white in colour and semi-\ntransparent  and  obliquely  set  at  the  medial  end  of  the  \nmeatus.  It  has  two  parts—pars  tensa  and  pars  flaccida,  \nboth of which should be carefully examined. Its various \nlandmarks  are  shown  in  Figure  76.5.  A  tympanic  mem-\nbrane is examined for:\n(a) Colour.  Red  and  congested  in  acute  otitis  media,  blu-\nish  in  secretory  otitis  media  or  haemotympanum.  A  \nchalky plaque is seen in tympanosclerosis.\n(b) Position.  Tympanic  membrane  may  be  retracting  or  \nbulging. General retraction is seen in tubal occlusion, \nretraction pockets are seen in attic or posterosuperior \nregion  and  may  collect  epithelial  flakes.  Sometimes,  \nFigure  76.3.

A probe test should be done. \nIt  ascertains  the  site  of  attachment,  consistency,  \nmobility  and  sensitiveness  of  the  mass.  Attachment  \nof  the  mass  is  found  by  passing  the  probe  on  all  its  \nsurfaces.  Bleeding  during  probing  indicates  vascular  \nnature of the mass.\n4. Posterior Rhinoscopy\nTechnique. Patient sits facing the examiner, opens his \nmouth  and  breathes  quietly  from  the  mouth.  The  ex-\naminer  depresses  the  tongue  with  a  tongue  depressor  \nand  introduces  posterior  rhinoscopic  mirror,  which  \nhas  been  warmed  and  tested  on  the  back  of  hand  \n( Figure 76.8). The mirror is held like a pen and carried \nbehind the soft palate. Without touching it on the pos-\nterior  third  of  tongue  to  avoid  gag  reflex,  light  from  \nthe  head  mirror  is  focussed  on  the  rhinoscopic  mir-\nror which further illuminates the part to be examined. \n Patient’s relaxation is important so that soft palate does \nnot contract.\nStructures  normally  seen  on  posterior  rhinoscopy  are  \nshown in Figure 76.9. Look for the following:\n(a) Choanal polyp or atresia.\n(b) Hypertrophy of posterior ends of inferior turbinates.\n(c)  Discharge  in  the  middle  meatus.  It  is  seen  in  infec-\ntions of maxillary, frontal or ethmoidal sinuses. Dis-\ncharge above the middle turbinate indicates infection \nof the posterior ethmoid or the sphenoid sinuses.\n5. Functional Examination of Nose\nTest for patency of the nose and sense of smell.\n(a) Patency of nose. (i) Spatula test. A clean cold tongue \ndepressor  is  held  below  the  nostrils  to  look  for  \nthe  area  of  mist  formation,  when  patient  exhales  \n( Figure 76.10), the two sides are compared.\n(ii) Cotton-wool test. A fluff of cotton is held against \neach nostril and its movements are noticed when \npatient inhales or exhales.\n(b) Sense of smell. A simple test is to ask the patient to \nidentify the smell of a solution or substance held be-\nfore  the  nostril  while  keeping  the  eyes  closed.  Each  \nnostril is tested separately. Common substances used \nare  the  clove  oil,  peppermint,  coffee  and  essence  of  \nrose.  Ammonia  stimulates  the  fibres  of  CN  V  and  is  \nnot used to test the sense of smell.\nFigure 76.8. Technique of posterior rhinoscopy.\nFigure 76.9.

Examine  \nthe colour of mucosa (congested in inflammation and \npale in allergy), size of turbinates (enlarged and swol-\nlen  in  hypertrophic  rhinitis,  small  and  rudimentary  \nin atrophic rhinitis), discharge (discharge in the mid-\ndle  meatus  indicates  infection  of  maxillary,  frontal  \nor  anterior  ethmoidal  sinuses),  mass  (polyp,  rhino-\nsporidiosis, carcinoma). A probe test should be done. \nIt  ascertains  the  site  of  attachment,  consistency,  \nmobility  and  sensitiveness  of  the  mass.  Attachment  \nof  the  mass  is  found  by  passing  the  probe  on  all  its  \nsurfaces.  Bleeding  during  probing  indicates  vascular  \nnature of the mass.\n4. Posterior Rhinoscopy\nTechnique.

Patient sits facing the examiner, opens his \nmouth  and  breathes  quietly  from  the  mouth.  The  ex-\naminer  depresses  the  tongue  with  a  tongue  depressor  \nand  introduces  posterior  rhinoscopic  mirror,  which  \nhas  been  warmed  and  tested  on  the  back  of  hand  \n( Figure 76.8). The mirror is held like a pen and carried \nbehind the soft palate. Without touching it on the pos-\nterior  third  of  tongue  to  avoid  gag  reflex,  light  from  \nthe  head  mirror  is  focussed  on  the  rhinoscopic  mir-\nror which further illuminates the part to be examined. \n Patient’s relaxation is important so that soft palate does \nnot contract.\nStructures  normally  seen  on  posterior  rhinoscopy  are  \nshown in Figure 76.9.

Maxillary Sinus\nIt is examined by inspection, palpation and trans-illumi-\nnation.\nMaxillary sinus has five walls and except for the poste-\nrior, all other walls can be examined directly.\nExamine:\n(a)  the  soft  tissues  of  cheek,  lip,  lower  eye  lid  and  the  \nmolar region,\n(b) the orbit and its contents, and the vision,\n(c) the vestibule of mouth by everting the lip,\n(d) upper alveolus, teeth and palate,\n(e) the nose by anterior and posterior rhinoscopy,\n(f)    tenderness    by    pressure    over    the    canine    fossa    \n (Figure 76.11).\nTransillumination  of  maxillary  sinus  is  done  by  plac-\ning a specially made light source centrally in the mouth \nand closing the lips. Normally, a crescent of light in the \ninferior  fornix  and  glow  in  the  pupil,  equally  bright  on  \nboth sides, can be seen. In the presence of pus, thickened \nmucosa or a neoplasm, the affected side does not transmit \nlight. This test has limited value and has practically been \nabandoned in favour of X-rays.\n2. Frontal Sinus\nIt is also examined by inspection, palpation and transil-\nlumination.\nFrontal  sinus  has  three  walls:  anterior,  posterior  and  \nfloor. Only the anterior wall and floor lend themselves to \nexternal examination.\n(a) External  examination.  For  this,  examine  the  fore-\nhead, root of nose, orbital margins, the orbit and its con-\ntents.  Look  for  redness,  swelling,  fistula,  proptosis  and  \ndisplacement of the eye balls.\nTenderness of the frontal sinus can be elicited by pres-\nsure or percussion with a finger on its anterior wall above \nthe medial part of eyebrow, or by pressing upwards on its \nfloor above the medial canthus (Figure 76.12).\n(b) Examination  of  nose.  Nose  should  be  examined  by  \nanterior  as  well  as  posterior  rhinoscopy  for  evidence  of  \ndischarge in the middle meatus and for any neoplasm.\nTransillumination  is  done  by  placing  a  small  light  \nsource in the superomedial angle of the orbit and observ-\ning the transmission of light from the anterior wall of the \nsinus. It is compared on both sides. Transillumination of \nfrontal sinus is of limited value and has practically been \nabandoned in favour of X-rays.\n3. Ethmoid Sinuses\nThey are divided into two groups: the anterior and pos-\nterior. The former drains below the middle turbinate and \nthe latter above it. They are examined by inspection and \npalpation.\n(a) External examination. It includes examination of or-\nbit,  upper  and  lower  eye  lids,  root  of  nose,  eye  ball  and  \nvision.\nTenderness can be elicited only in the anterior ethmoid \nsinuses.  This  is  done  by  gentle  pressure  applied  on  the  \nmedial wall of orbit just behind the root of nose. The area \nis tender in acute ethmoiditis.\n(b) Nasal examination. Anterior rhinoscopy may reveal \npus,  polypi,  or  growth  in  the  middle  meatus  (anterior  \ngroup  of  ethmoid  sinuses)  or  between  the  middle  turbi-\nnate and the septum (posterior group of ethmoid sinus-\nes). Probe test should be done to find the consistency, at-\ntachment and friability of the mass.\nPosterior rhinoscopy may reveal pus or growth, below \nor above the middle turbinate.\n4. Sphenoid Sinus\nSphenoid  sinus  lies  deep  and  is  not  easy  to  examine  di-\nrectly. Sometimes, its anterior wall can be seen in atroph-\nic  rhinitis  or  in  marked  deviation  of  the  septum  to  the  \nopposite side.\n(a) Anterior  rhinoscopy.  Sphenoid  sinus  opens  in  the  \nsphenoethmoidal  recess.  Attention  should  therefore  be  \npaid to the findings in the olfactory fissure near the roof \nof nose. It may show discharge, crusts, polyp or growth. A \nprobe can be used to palpate the mass.\n(b) Posterior rhinoscopy. It may reveal pus in the naso-\npharynx or the choana, above the middle or superior tur-\nbinate. A growth or a polyp may also be seen.\nFigure  76.11.

Soft Palate\nLook  for  redness  (peritonsillitis),  bulge  or  swelling.  Nor-\nmally,  uvula  is  in  the  midline.  It  becomes  oedematous  \nand  displaced  to  the  opposite  side  in  peritonsillar  ab-\nscess.

It is \nnot unusual to see an absent uvula and a scar in the soft \npalate in such patients.\n3. Posterior Pharyngeal Wall\nIt can be seen directly. Look for lymphoid nodules (gran-\nular  pharyngitis),  purulent  discharge  trickling  down  the  \nposterior   pharyngeal   wall   (sinusitis),   hypertrophy   of   \nlateral  pharyngeal  bands  just  behind  the  posterior  pil-\nlars  (chronic  sinusitis),  thin  glazed  mucosa  and  crusting  \n(atrophic pharyngitis).\n4. Base of Tongue and Valleculae\nPosterior one-third of tongue forms the base of tongue and \nlies  between  the  V-shaped  row  of  circumvallate  papillae  \nand the valleculae. Valleculae are two shallow depressions \nwhich lie between the base of tongue and the epiglottis.\nBase of tongue and valleculae are best examined by in-\ndirect laryngoscopy and finger palpation.\n(a) indirect  laryngoscopy.

Flexible or rigid fibreoptic endoscopy.\n4. Assessment of voice.\n5. Assessment of cervical lymph nodes.\n1. External Examination of Larynx\nBoth inspection and palpation are employed. Look for:\n(a) Redness of skin (abscess, perichondritis).\n(b) Bulge  or  swelling  (extension  of  growth  or  enlarged  \nlymph nodes).\n(c) Widening of larynx (growth of pyriform fossa).\n(d) Surgical emphysema (accidental or surgical trauma).\n(e) Change in contour or displacement of laryngeal structures \n(trauma  or  neoplasm).  Palpate  the  hyoid  bone,  thy-\nroid  cartilage,  thyroid  notch,  cricoid  cartilage,  and  \nthe tracheal rings.\n(f) Movements of larynx. Normally, larynx moves with de-\nglutition. It can also be moved from side to side produc-\ning a characteristic grating sound (laryngeal crepitus). \nFixity of larynx indicates inflammation or infiltration \nof  growth  into  the  surrounding  structures.  Loss  of  \nlaryngeal crepitus is due to postcricoid carcinoma.\n2. Indirect Laryngoscopy\nTechnique.  Patient  is  seated  opposite  the  examiner.

It has:\n1. An external opening along the anterior border of ster-\nnocleidomastoid muscle.\n2. A tract which ascends just deep to deep cervical fascia \nalong the carotid artery.\n3.  The  tract  passes  deep  to  second  arch  structures,  i.e.  \nexternal carotid artery, stylohyoid and posterior belly \nof  digastric  but  superficial  to  third  arch  structure,  i.e.  \ninternal carotid artery (the tract passes between internal \nand external carotid arteries).

It presents as an \nisolated  swelling  in  the  submandibular  area  and  is  tran-\nsilluminant.  Sometimes  plunging  ranula  coexists  with  a  \nranula in the floor of mouth. Treatment is total excision \nalong with removal of sublingual salivary gland.\nCAROTID BODY TUMOUR\nIt arises from the chemoreceptor cells in the carotid body, \nhence  also  called  chemodectoma.  Mostly  presents  after  \n40 years. It is a very slow-growing tumour and the history \nof mass in the neck may extend into several years. It pre-\nsents  as  a  painless  swelling  which  is  pulsatile.  Bruit  can  \nbe  heard  with  a  stethoscope.  It  moves  from  side  to  side  \nbut not vertically. It may extend into the parapharyngeal \nspace and present in the oropharynx (Figure 77.6).\nContrast-enhanced CT and MRI with gadolinium are di-\nagnostic and also show the extent of the tumour. MRI angi-\nography shows splaying of internal and external carotid ar-\nteries (Lyre’s sign). Some tumours are functional and secrete \ncatecholamines. Hence serum catecholamines and urinary \nmetanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) should be \nestimated. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or biop-\nsy should not be done because of the vascularity of tumour.\nTreatment  is  surgical  when  the  patient  is  younger  \nthan 50 years and surgically fit, or when the tumour ex-\ntends  into  the  oropharynx  causing  difficulty  in  speech,  \nswallowing or breathing.\nRadiotherapy is also effective and is used in older pa-\ntients and those unfit for surgery or those who refuse sur-\ngery or have a metastatic disease.\nPARAPHARYNGEAL TUMOURS\nThese tumours present in the upper neck near the angle \nof mandible or retromandibular area.\nThey may also be seen intraorally displacing the tonsil, \nlateral pharyngeal wall and soft palate medially.

It arises from obstruction or sequestra-\ntion of the jugular lymph sac.\nIt may be seen in the neonate, early infancy or child-\nhood.

Other  lymphatic  \nstructures of the Waldeyer ring may also be involved and \ncause symptoms of dysphagia, serous otitis media or res-\npiratory  obstruction.  In  such  cases,  other  lymph  nodes  \nin the axilla, groin and abdomen should be examined in \naddition to spleen and liver enlargement.\nCERVICAL RIB\nOccasionally an extra rib may arise from the seventh cer-\nvical vertebra and end anteriorly by attaching to the first \nrib. This rib may produce a bony hard lump in the supra-\nclavicular  region.  Most  often  it  is  seen  on  the  right  but  \nmay be present on the left bilaterally.\nSubclavian  artery  and  brachial  plexus  which  normally  \npass between anterior and middle scalene muscles over the \nfirst rib have now to pass over the cervical rib (a vertebral \nspace  higher)  and  thus  get  compressed.  It  produces  neu-\nrological or vascular symptoms. Patient may complain of \ntingling  sensation  or  numbness  along  the  upper  side  of  \nforearm  and  hand  due  to  compression  of  the  lower  part  \nof brachial plexus. When subclavian artery is compressed, \nhand becomes cold and numb with intermittent claudica-\ntion of upper limb. Due to arterial compression an aneu-\nrysm may develop mural thrombus which may shoot em-\nboli to the distal arterial system of the upper limb. Cervical \nrib, if asymptomatic, does not require treatment but symp-\ntomatic ones are excised by supraclavicular or transaxillary \napproach.\nSTERNOMASTOID TUMOUR\nMostly seen in the newborns due to birth trauma. Fibrosis \nand  later  shortening  of  the  sternocleidomastoid  muscle  \ncauses torticollis. Face is turned to opposite side but the \nhead  is  tilted  on  the  ipsilateral  shoulder.  A  mass  can  be  \npalpated  in  the  sternocleidomastoid  muscle  on  physical  \nexamination.  In  long-standing  cases,  asymmetry  of  face  \nand head can develop as a sequel.\nTreatment  is  passive  exercises  of  the  neck  in  early  \nstages.  Surgery  is  done  when  the  condition  is  persistent  \nand  likely  to  cause  facial  hemihypoplasia.  It  consists  of  \ndivision of sternomastoid muscle.\nmebooksfree.com",

Other  lymphatic  \nstructures of the Waldeyer ring may also be involved and \ncause symptoms of dysphagia, serous otitis media or res-\npiratory  obstruction.  In  such  cases,  other  lymph  nodes  \nin the axilla, groin and abdomen should be examined in \naddition to spleen and liver enlargement.\nCERVICAL RIB\nOccasionally an extra rib may arise from the seventh cer-\nvical vertebra and end anteriorly by attaching to the first",
        "addition to spleen and liver enlargement.\nCERVICAL RIB\nOccasionally an extra rib may arise from the seventh cer-\nvical vertebra and end anteriorly by attaching to the first \nrib. This rib may produce a bony hard lump in the supra-\nclavicular  region.  Most  often  it  is  seen  on  the  right  but  \nmay be present on the left bilaterally.\nSubclavian  artery  and  brachial  plexus  which  normally  \npass between anterior and middle scalene muscles over the \nfirst rib have now to pass over the cervical rib (a vertebral \nspace  higher)  and  thus  get  compressed.  It  produces  neu-\nrological or vascular symptoms. Patient may complain of \ntingling  sensation  or  numbness  along  the  upper  side  of  \nforearm  and  hand  due  to  compression  of  the  lower  part  \nof brachial plexus. When subclavian artery is compressed, \nhand becomes cold and numb with intermittent claudica-\ntion of upper limb.

Due to arterial compression an aneu-\nrysm may develop mural thrombus which may shoot em-\nboli to the distal arterial system of the upper limb. Cervical \nrib, if asymptomatic, does not require treatment but symp-\ntomatic ones are excised by supraclavicular or transaxillary \napproach.\nSTERNOMASTOID TUMOUR\nMostly seen in the newborns due to birth trauma. Fibrosis \nand  later  shortening  of  the  sternocleidomastoid  muscle  \ncauses torticollis. Face is turned to opposite side but the \nhead  is  tilted  on  the  ipsilateral  shoulder.  A  mass  can  be  \npalpated  in  the  sternocleidomastoid  muscle  on  physical  \nexamination.

This means ossicular reconstruction only or ossicular \nreconstruction with myringoplasty.\nTympanoplasty with Mastoidectomy\nIt  is  an  operation  to  eradicate  disease  in  both  the  mas-\ntoid  and  middle  ear  cavity,  and  to  reconstruct  the  hear-\ning  mechanism  with  or  without  tympanic  membrane  \ngrafting.\nCortical Mastoidectomy (Simple \nMastoidectomy or Schwartz Operation)\nIt is an exenteration of all accessible mastoid air cells pre-\nserving the posterior meatal wall.\nModified Radical Mastoidectomy\nIt  is  an  operation  to  eradicate  disease  of  the  attic  and  \nmastoid,  both  of  which  are  exteriorized  into  the  exter-\nnal auditory canal by removal of the posterior meatal and \nlateral  attic  walls.  Tympanic  membrane  remnant,  func-\ntioning  ossicles  and  the  reversible  mucosa  and  function  \nof the eustachian tube are preserved. These structures are \nnecessary to reconstruct hearing mechanism at the time \nof surgery or in a second-stage operation.\nRadical Mastoidectomy\nIt  is  an  operation  to  eradicate  disease  of  the  middle  ear  \nand mastoid in which mastoid, middle ear, attic and the \nantrum are exteriorized into the external ear by removal \nof  posterior  meatal  wall.  All  remnants  of  the  tympanic  \nmembrane, ossicles (including malleus and incus but not \nthe stapes), chorda tympani and the mucoperiosteal lin-\ning are removed, and the opening of the eustachian tube \nis closed by packing a piece of muscle or cartilage into it.\nMeatoplasty\nMeatoplasty is an operation in which a crescent of conchal \ncartilage  is  excised  to  widen  the  meatus.  It  is  invariably  \ncombined with all canal wall down procedures, i.e. modi-\nfied  radical  and  radical  mastoidectomies  for  easy  access  \nto mastoid cavity for periodic inspection and cleaning. It \nis also done as an isolated procedure in a sagging auricle \nseen in older people. Sagging auricle obstructs the ear ca-\nnal and causes hearing loss and retention of wax.\nMastoid Obliteration\nIt is an operation to eradicate mastoid disease, when pre-\nsent, and to obliterate the mastoid cavity. Obliteration of \nmastoid  cavity  is  done  with  pedicled  temporalis  muscle  \nor musculofascial tissue raised as flaps.\nSURGICAL APPROACHES TO THE EAR \nAND INCISIONS\n1. endomeatal or  transcanal  approach.  It  is  used  \nto raise a tympanomeatal flap in order to expose the mid-\ndle ear. Rosen’s incision is the most commonly used for \nstapedectomy. It requires the meatus and canal to be wide \nenough to work. It consists of two parts: (i) a small verti-\ncal incision at 12 o’clock position near the annulus and \n(ii) a curvilinear incision starting at 6 o’clock position to \nmeet  the  first  incision  in  the  posterosuperior  region  of  \nthe canals, 5–7 mm away from the annulus (Figure 79.1) \nPosterior  meatal  canal  skin  is  raised  in  continuity  with  \ntympanic membrane, after dislocating the annulus from \nthe  sulcus.  It  gives  a  good  view  of  the  middle  ear  and  \nossicles.  Stapes,  if  still  covered  by  posterosuperior  over-\nhang of bony meatus, can be exposed by removing this \npart  of  the  overhang.  This  incision  is  also  used  com-\nmonly  for  exploratory  tympanotomy  to  find  cause  for  \nconductive hearing loss, inlay myringoplasty or ossicular \nreconstruction.\n2. endaural approach. It is used for:\n(a) Excision of osteomas or exostosis of ear canal.\n(b) Large tympanic membrane perforations.\n(c) Attic cholesteatomas with limited extension into the \nantrum.\n(d) Modified radical mastoidectomy where disease is lim-\nited to attic, antrum and part of mastoid.\nEndaural approach is made through Lempert’s incision \n(Figure 79.2).

        "ing  mechanism  with  or  without  tympanic  membrane  \ngrafting.\nCortical Mastoidectomy (Simple \nMastoidectomy or Schwartz Operation)\nIt is an exenteration of all accessible mastoid air cells pre-\nserving the posterior meatal wall.\nModified Radical Mastoidectomy\nIt  is  an  operation  to  eradicate  disease  of  the  attic  and  \nmastoid,  both  of  which  are  exteriorized  into  the  exter-\nnal auditory canal by removal of the posterior meatal and \nlateral  attic  walls.  Tympanic  membrane  remnant,  func-\ntioning  ossicles  and  the  reversible  mucosa  and  function  \nof the eustachian tube are preserved. These structures are \nnecessary to reconstruct hearing mechanism at the time \nof surgery or in a second-stage operation.\nRadical Mastoidectomy\nIt  is  an  operation  to  eradicate  disease  of  the  middle  ear  \nand mastoid in which mastoid, middle ear, attic and the \nantrum are exteriorized into the external ear by removal",
        "It  is  an  operation  to  eradicate  disease  of  the  middle  ear  \nand mastoid in which mastoid, middle ear, attic and the \nantrum are exteriorized into the external ear by removal \nof  posterior  meatal  wall.  All  remnants  of  the  tympanic  \nmembrane, ossicles (including malleus and incus but not \nthe stapes), chorda tympani and the mucoperiosteal lin-\ning are removed, and the opening of the eustachian tube \nis closed by packing a piece of muscle or cartilage into it.\nMeatoplasty\nMeatoplasty is an operation in which a crescent of conchal \ncartilage  is  excised  to  widen  the  meatus.  It  is  invariably  \ncombined with all canal wall down procedures, i.e. modi-\nfied  radical  and  radical  mastoidectomies  for  easy  access  \nto mastoid cavity for periodic inspection and cleaning. It \nis also done as an isolated procedure in a sagging auricle \nseen in older people. Sagging auricle obstructs the ear ca-\nnal and causes hearing loss and retention of wax.\nMastoid Obliteration",
        "is also done as an isolated procedure in a sagging auricle \nseen in older people. Sagging auricle obstructs the ear ca-\nnal and causes hearing loss and retention of wax.\nMastoid Obliteration\nIt is an operation to eradicate mastoid disease, when pre-\nsent, and to obliterate the mastoid cavity. Obliteration of \nmastoid  cavity  is  done  with  pedicled  temporalis  muscle  \nor musculofascial tissue raised as flaps.\nSURGICAL APPROACHES TO THE EAR \nAND INCISIONS\n1. endomeatal or  transcanal  approach.  It  is  used  \nto raise a tympanomeatal flap in order to expose the mid-\ndle ear. Rosen’s incision is the most commonly used for \nstapedectomy. It requires the meatus and canal to be wide \nenough to work. It consists of two parts: (i) a small verti-\ncal incision at 12 o’clock position near the annulus and \n(ii) a curvilinear incision starting at 6 o’clock position to \nmeet  the  first  incision  in  the  posterosuperior  region  of  \nthe canals, 5–7 mm away from the annulus (Figure 79.1)",
        "(ii) a curvilinear incision starting at 6 o’clock position to \nmeet  the  first  incision  in  the  posterosuperior  region  of  \nthe canals, 5–7 mm away from the annulus (Figure 79.1) \nPosterior  meatal  canal  skin  is  raised  in  continuity  with  \ntympanic membrane, after dislocating the annulus from \nthe  sulcus.  It  gives  a  good  view  of  the  middle  ear  and  \nossicles.  Stapes,  if  still  covered  by  posterosuperior  over-\nhang of bony meatus, can be exposed by removing this \npart  of  the  overhang.  This  incision  is  also  used  com-\nmonly  for  exploratory  tympanotomy  to  find  cause  for  \nconductive hearing loss, inlay myringoplasty or ossicular \nreconstruction.\n2. endaural approach. It is used for:\n(a) Excision of osteomas or exostosis of ear canal.\n(b) Large tympanic membrane perforations.\n(c) Attic cholesteatomas with limited extension into the \nantrum.\n(d) Modified radical mastoidectomy where disease is lim-\nited to attic, antrum and part of mastoid.",
        "(c) Attic cholesteatomas with limited extension into the \nantrum.\n(d) Modified radical mastoidectomy where disease is lim-\nited to attic, antrum and part of mastoid.\nEndaural approach is made through Lempert’s incision \n(Figure 79.2). It consists of two parts:\nmebooksfree.com"

Posterior meatal wall is removed and \nthe entire area of middle ear, attic, antrum and mastoid is \nconverted into a single cavity. All remnants of tympanic \nmembrane,  ossicles  (except  stapes  footplate)  and  muco-\nperiosteal  lining  are  removed  (Figure  81.1).  Eustachian  \ntube is obliterated by a piece of muscle or cartilage. Aim \nof  the  operation  is  to  permanently  exteriorize  the  dis-\neased area for inspection and cleaning. The radical mas-\ntoidectomy is infrequently required these days.\nINDICATIONS\n1. When all cholesteatoma cannot be safely removed, e.g. \nthat  invading  eustachian  tube,  round  window  niche,  \nperilabyrinthine or hypotympanic cells.\n2. If previous attempts to eradicate chronic inflammatory \ndisease or cholesteatoma have failed.\n3. As an approach to petrous apex.\n4. Removal of glomus tumour.\n5.  Carcinoma  middle  ear.

        "459\nChapter 81\nRadical Mastoidectomy\nRadical mastoidectomy is a procedure to eradicate disease \nfrom the middle ear and mastoid without any attempt to \nreconstruct hearing. Posterior meatal wall is removed and \nthe entire area of middle ear, attic, antrum and mastoid is \nconverted into a single cavity. All remnants of tympanic \nmembrane,  ossicles  (except  stapes  footplate)  and  muco-\nperiosteal  lining  are  removed  (Figure  81.1).  Eustachian  \ntube is obliterated by a piece of muscle or cartilage. Aim \nof  the  operation  is  to  permanently  exteriorize  the  dis-\neased area for inspection and cleaning. The radical mas-\ntoidectomy is infrequently required these days.\nINDICATIONS\n1. When all cholesteatoma cannot be safely removed, e.g. \nthat  invading  eustachian  tube,  round  window  niche,  \nperilabyrinthine or hypotympanic cells.\n2.

Inspecting  the  middle  ear.  A  stapes-type  incision  is  \nmade and the tympanomeatal flap raised to see the in-\ntegrity and mobility of the ossicular chain and to en-\nsure that no squamous epithelium has grown into the \nmiddle ear.\n4. Placing the graft. Middle ear is packed with gelfoam \nsoaked with an antibiotic. A proper-sized graft is placed \nso that its edges extend under the margins of perfora-\ntion  all  round  and  a  small  part  also  extends  over  the  \nposterior  canal  wall.  Tympanomeatal  flap  is  replaced.  \nAn  underlay  technique  has  the  advantage  that  the  \nsquamous  epithelium  is  not  buried  in  the  middle  ear  \n(Figure 83.1).\nOVERLAY TECHNIQUE\n1.  Temporal  fascia  or  perichondrial  graft  is  harvested  as  \nabove.\n2. Incision is made in the meatus as shown in Figure 83.2 \nand meatal skin raised along with all epithelium from \nthe outer surface of tympanic membrane remnant and \npreserved to be used later.\n3.

It has the advantage of:\n1.  restoring  the  hearing  loss  and  in  some  cases  the  \n tinnitus.\n2. checking repeated infection from external auditory ca-\nnal and eustachian tube (nasopharyngeal infection as-\ncends more easily via eustachian tube in the presence \nof perforation than otherwise).\n3.  checking  aeroallergens  reaching  the  exposed  middle  \near mucosa, leading to persistent ear discharge.\nMyringoplasty  should  be  differentiated  from  type  I  \ntympanoplasty. Though both refer to repair of tympanic \nmembrane,  tympanoplasty  entails  exposure  of  the  mid-\ndle ear to inspect the middle ear and also ensure ossicular \nintegrity.\nMyringoplasty can be combined with ossicular recon-\nstruction when it is called tympanoplasty.\nPhysiologic  principles  for  middle  ear  reconstruction  \nare discussed on p. 31.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS",

Active discharge from the middle ear.\n2.  Nasal  allergy.  It  should  be  brought  under  control  be-\nfore surgery.\n3. Otitis externa.\n4. Ingrowth of squamous epithelium into the middle ear. \nIn  such  cases,  excision  of  squamous  epithelium  from  \nthe  middle  ear  or  a  tympanomastoidectomy  may  be  \nrequired.\n5.

Periosteum\nIncision for exposure of tympanic membrane depends \non the size of the ear canal; it may be endomeatal, endau-\nral or postaural.\nTECHNIQUE\nUNDERLAY TECHNIQUE\n1. Harvesting the graft, e.g. of temporalis fascia; or peri-\nchondrium from the tragus.\n2. Preparing the tympanic membrane for grafting. An \nincision is made along the edge of perforation and the \nring  of  epithelium  removed.  Remove  also  a  strip  of  \nmucosal layer from the inner side of perforation.\n3. Inspecting  the  middle  ear.  A  stapes-type  incision  is  \nmade and the tympanomeatal flap raised to see the in-\ntegrity and mobility of the ossicular chain and to en-\nsure that no squamous epithelium has grown into the \nmiddle ear.\n4.

Middle ear is packed with gelfoam \nsoaked with an antibiotic. A proper-sized graft is placed \nso that its edges extend under the margins of perfora-\ntion  all  round  and  a  small  part  also  extends  over  the  \nposterior  canal  wall.  Tympanomeatal  flap  is  replaced.  \nAn  underlay  technique  has  the  advantage  that  the  \nsquamous  epithelium  is  not  buried  in  the  middle  ear  \n(Figure 83.1).\nOVERLAY TECHNIQUE\n1.  Temporal  fascia  or  perichondrial  graft  is  harvested  as  \nabove.\n2.

In the event of frontal sinus disease, frontal \nrecess is cleared and frontal sinus drainage established.\n  Opening  of  frontal  sinus  is  situated  lateral  to  attach-\nment  of  middle  turbinate,  medial  to  medial  orbital  \nwall,  anterior  to  anterior  ethmoidal  artery  and  poste-\nrior to agger nasi cell(s). Surgery in the area of frontal \nrecess is challenging as any disrespect to the mucosa in \nthis area would lead to stenosis of frontal sinus opening \nwith mucocele formation or recurrent frontal sinusitis.\n6. Sphenoidotomy.  This  step  is  done  after  clearance  of  \nposterior ethmoid cells or after frontal sinusotomy. It \nis omitted if sinus is healthy. In this procedure anterior \nwall of sphenoid sinus is removed, and pus and inspis-\nsated  material  from  within  the  sinus  removed.  There  \nare two ways to remove the anterior sinus wall:\n(a)  By  entering  the  sphenoid  sinus  anterior  and  in-\nferior  to  the  ethmoid  cavity  created  by  the  above  \nsteps.\n(b)  By  enlarging  the  opening  of  sphenoid  sinus  with  \nBlakesley  forceps  or  J-curette.

For allergic patients.\n4. Analgesics. For relief of postoperative pain.\n5. Nasal  irrigations.  Saline  irrigations  are  started  after  \n1 week postoperatively to remove blood clots, crusts and \nsecretions and continued once or twice a day for 1 week.\n6. Steroid nasal sprays. Required in cases of nasal allergy \nor those operated for nasal polyps.\n7. Endoscopic  toilet.

Sphenoidotomy.  This  step  is  done  after  clearance  of  \nposterior ethmoid cells or after frontal sinusotomy. It \nis omitted if sinus is healthy. In this procedure anterior \nwall of sphenoid sinus is removed, and pus and inspis-\nsated  material  from  within  the  sinus  removed.  There  \nare two ways to remove the anterior sinus wall:\n(a)  By  entering  the  sphenoid  sinus  anterior  and  in-\nferior  to  the  ethmoid  cavity  created  by  the  above  \nsteps.\n(b)  By  enlarging  the  opening  of  sphenoid  sinus  with  \nBlakesley  forceps  or  J-curette.  Sinus  opening  is  \nidentified  after  removal  of  the  posterior-inferior  \nportion of superior turbinate near the nasal septum \nand about 1.0 cm above the upper border of poste-\nrior choana.\n7.

      "content": "483\nChapter 92\nBronchoscopy\nBronchoscopy is of two types:\n1.  Rigid.\n2. Flexible fibreoptic.\nRIGID BRONCHOSCOPY\nINDICATIONS\nDiagnostic\n1. To find out the cause for wheezing, haemoptysis or un-\nexplained cough persisting for more than 4 weeks.\n2. When X-ray chest shows:\n(a) Atelectasis of a segment, lobe or entire lung.\n(b) Opacity localized to a segment or lobe of lung.\n(c) Obstructive emphysema—to exclude foreign body.\n(d) Hilar or mediastinal shadows.\n3. Vocal cord palsy.\n4. Collection of bronchial secretions for culture and sen-\nsitivity  tests,  acid  fast  bacilli,  fungus  and  malignant  \ncells.\nTherapeutic\n1. Removal of foreign bodies.\n2. Removal of retained secretions or mucus plug in cases \nof head injuries, chest trauma, thoracic or abdominal \nsurgery, or comatosed patients.\nANAESTHESIA\nGeneral  anaesthesia  with  no  endotracheal  tube  or  with  \nonly a small bore catheter is often preferred. It can also be \ndone under topical surface anaesthesia.\nPOSITION\nSame as for direct laryngoscopy.\nTECHNIQUE\nThere are two methods to introduce bronchoscope:\n1. Direct  method.  Here  bronchoscope  is  introduced  di-\nrectly through the glottis.\n2. Through  laryngoscope.  Here  glottis  is  first  exposed  \nwith the help of a spatular type laryngoscope and then \nthe  bronchoscope  is  introduced  through  the  laryn-\ngoscope  into  the  trachea.  Laryngoscope  is  then  with-\ndrawn.  This  method  is  useful  in  infants  and  young  \nchildren, and in adults who have short neck and thick \ntongue.\nDETAILS OF TECHNIQUE\n1. A piece of gauze or a dental guard is placed on the up-\nper teeth for their protection against injury.\n2.  Proper-sized  bronchoscope  is  lubricated  with  a  swab  \nof autoclaved liquid paraffin or jelly. It is held by the \nshaft in surgeon’s right hand in a pen-like fashion.

A mouth wash with plain \nwater after every feed helps to keep the mouth clean.\n4. analgesics. Pain, locally in the throat and referred to \nthe ear, can be relieved by analgesics like paracetamol. An \nanalgesic can be given half an hour before meals. Avoid \naspirin and ibuprofen as it can cause bleeding due to de-\ncrease in platelet adhesiveness.\n5. antibiotics. A suitable antibiotic can be given orally \nor by injection for a week.\nPatient is usually sent home 24 h after operation un-\nless  there  is  some  complication.  Patient  can  resume  his  \nnormal duties within 2 weeks.\nOther methods for tonsillectomy (Table 94.1).\n1. Guillotine  method.  Largely  abandoned.  It  can  be  \ndone only when tonsils are mobile and tonsil bed has \nnot been scarred by repeated infections.\n2. Electrocautery. Both unipolar and bipolar electrocau-\ntery  has  been  used.  It  reduces  blood  loss  but  causes  \nthermal injury to tissues.\n3. Laser tonsillectomy. It is indicated in coagulation dis-\norders.  Both  KTP-512  and  CO\n2\n  lasers  have  been  used  \nbut the former is preferred. Technique is similar to the \none used in dissection method.\n4. Laser  tonsillotomy.  Another  method  is  laser  ton-\nsillotomy,  which  aims  to  reduce  the  size  of  tonsils.  \nIt  is  indicated  in  patients  who  are  unable  to  toler-\nate general anaesthesia. Tonsils are reduced by laser \nablation  up  to  anterior  pillars  in  stages  by  repeated  \napplications.\n5. Intracapsular tonsillectomy. With the use of powered \ninstruments (debrider) tonsil is removed but its capsule \nis preserved in the hope to reduce postoperative pain.\n6. Harmonic  scalpel.  It  uses  ultrasound  to  cut  and  co-\nagulate tissues. It is a cold method and causes less tis-\nsue  damage  and  less  postoperative  pain  compared  to  \nelectrocautery technique.\n7. Plasma-mediated  ablation  technique.  In  this  abla-\ntion method, protons are energized to break molecular \nbonds  between  tissues.  It  is  a  cold  method  and  does  \nnot cause thermal injury.\n8. Coblation tonsillectomy. See p. 406\n9. Cryosurgical  technique.  Tonsil  is  frozen  by  appli-\ncation  of  cryoprobe  and  then  allowed  to  thaw.  Two  \napplications,  each  of  3–4  min,  are  applied.  Tonsillar  \ntissue will undergo necrosis and later fall off leaving a \ngranulating surface. Bleeding is less due to thrombosis \nof vessels caused by freezing.\nCOMPLICATIONS\nA. IMMEDIATE\n1. Primary  haemorrhage.  Occurs  at  the  time  of  opera-\ntion. It can be controlled by pressure, ligation or elec-\ntrocoagulation of the bleeding vessels.\n2. Reactionary haemorrhage. Occurs within a period of \n24 h and can be controlled by simple measures such as \nremoval of the clot, application of pressure or vasocon-\nstrictor. Presence of a clot prevents the clipping action \nof the superior constrictor muscle on the vessels which \npass  through  it  (compare  postpartum  uterine  bleed-\ning). If above measures fail, ligation or electrocoagula-\ntion of the bleeding vessels can be done under general \nanaesthesia.\n3.

A mouth wash with plain \nwater after every feed helps to keep the mouth clean.\n4. analgesics. Pain, locally in the throat and referred to \nthe ear, can be relieved by analgesics like paracetamol. An \nanalgesic can be given half an hour before meals. Avoid \naspirin and ibuprofen as it can cause bleeding due to de-\ncrease in platelet adhesiveness.\n5. antibiotics.

Both  KTP-512  and  CO\n2\n  lasers  have  been  used  \nbut the former is preferred. Technique is similar to the \none used in dissection method.\n4. Laser  tonsillotomy.  Another  method  is  laser  ton-\nsillotomy,  which  aims  to  reduce  the  size  of  tonsils.  \nIt  is  indicated  in  patients  who  are  unable  to  toler-\nate general anaesthesia. Tonsils are reduced by laser \nablation  up  to  anterior  pillars  in  stages  by  repeated  \napplications.\n5. Intracapsular tonsillectomy.

Harmonic  scalpel.  It  uses  ultrasound  to  cut  and  co-\nagulate tissues. It is a cold method and causes less tis-\nsue  damage  and  less  postoperative  pain  compared  to  \nelectrocautery technique.\n7. Plasma-mediated  ablation  technique.  In  this  abla-\ntion method, protons are energized to break molecular \nbonds  between  tissues.  It  is  a  cold  method  and  does  \nnot cause thermal injury.\n8. Coblation tonsillectomy. See p. 406\n9. Cryosurgical  technique.  Tonsil  is  frozen  by  appli-\ncation  of  cryoprobe  and  then  allowed  to  thaw.  Two  \napplications,  each  of  3–4  min,  are  applied.  Tonsillar  \ntissue will undergo necrosis and later fall off leaving a \ngranulating surface. Bleeding is less due to thrombosis \nof vessels caused by freezing.\nCOMPLICATIONS\nA. IMMEDIATE",

The  images  taken  from  \naxial  view  can  be  reconstructed  into  coronal  or  sagittal  \nplanes.  CT  scans  can  be  used  to  create  very  thin  slices  \n1–1.5 mm for precision. These high-resolution images are \nneeded  for  temporal  bones  so  that  closely  placed  struc-\ntures can also be seen (Figures 96.27–96.36).\nSometimes  a  contrast  containing  iodine  material  is  \nalso  injected  to  better  define  blood  vessels  and  tissues  \n(contrast-enhanced images).\nSince  CT  scan  uses  X-ray  beams,  they  produce  ef-\nfects  of  ionization  radiation.  Thinner  the  slices  more  is  \nthe radiation dose delivered and thus contraindicated in \npregnancy.\nUSES OF CT\n1.  Images  taken  in  one  plane  can  be  reconstructed  into  \nother planes. Thus CT scan taken in axial view can be \nreconstructed in coronal and sagittal plane.\n2. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions can be made. \nThey are useful, say, in facial bone fractures and head \n& neck tumours.\n3.  Slices  can  be  made  thin  with  reduction  in  interslice  \nspace called high-resolution CT (HRCT). They are use-\nful in CT of temporal bones and show finer structures \nlike ossicles, facial nerve, labyrinth and internal audi-\ntory canal. Similarly, details of other smaller tumours \ncan be seen.\n4.  Spiral  CT  helps  perform  virtual  endoscopy  of  larynx  \nand  tracheobronchoscopy  and  is  thus  a  non-invasive  \ntechnique.\n5.  By  using  contrast,  lymph  nodes  of  the  neck  in  con-\njunction with malignant tumour can be delineated.\n6. More precise aspiration cytology of deep tumours can \nbe taken under CT guidance.\nMAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)\nThis modality uses magnetic field to study the tissues. In \ncontrast to CT, it does not use any ionizing radiation. Di-\nrect  images  can  be  taken  in  any  plane—the  axial,  coro-\nnal,  sagittal  or  oblique.  Machines  used  have  a  magnetic  \nstrength of 0.5, 1.5 or 3 Tesla. One Tesla is equivalent to \n10,000 Gauss (G). Magnetic field of earth has a strength of \nonly 0.5 Gauss. As the tissues are subjected to high mag-\nnetic field, their protons realign with the magnetic field, \nlose energy, and produce a signal which can be measured \nand  reconstructed  into  an  image.  Higher  the  magnetic  \nfield created by machine, better are the images.\nPULSE SEQUENCES OF MRI\nVarious pulse sequences are used in MRI and include:\n•\tT\n1\n weighted\n•\tT\n2\n weighted\n•\tSpin (proton) density\n•\tGadolinium enhanced\n•\tFat suppression\n•\tGradient echo imaging\n•\tMagnetic resonance angiography\nT\n1\n W and T\n2 \nW images are created by varying repetition \ntime (TR) and echo time (TE) to produce contrast between \nthe tissues. Inversion time (TI) is used in fat suppression \nstudies to see inversion recovery time (Table 96.1).\nADVANTAGES OF MRI\n•\tNo radiation hazard.\n•\tDirect images can be produced in axial, coronal, sagittal \nor oblique planes without changing patient’s position.\n•\tSoft tissues are differentiated better than in CT images.\n•\tTumour  margins  are  defined  better.  This  is  important  \nwhen  extension  of  tumour  is  to  be  seen  in  orbital  or  \nintracranial structures.\nDISADVANTAGES OF MRI\n•\tTakes long time to take images.\n•\tProne to motion artefacts; patient has to lie still with \nslow  breathing  and  swallowing.  This  is  important  in  \nchildren and uncooperative patients. Sometimes gen-\neral anaesthesia is required.\n•\tMore expensive than CT.\n•\tContraindicated  if  patient  is  using  cardiac  pace  mak-\ners, cochlear implants (now some implants can toler-\nate higher Tesla strength), intracranial aneurysm clips, \nmetallic foreign body in orbit (take an X-ray before do-\ning MRI) or metallic ossicular implants.\n MRI should be avoided in first trimester of pregnancy.\nPET-CT AND PET-MRI\nPositron  emission  tomography  (PET)  is  based  on  the  \nfact  that  metabolically  active  tissues  (cancer  cells)  takes  \nup glucose preferentially than the normal tissue. A radi-\notracer  substance  is  combined  with  glucose  to  localize  \ncancerous  tissue.  2-(F\n18\n)  fluoro-2deoxy-glucose  (FDG)  is  \nthe most often used substance. CT is combined with PET \nto  localize  the  area.  These  days  PET  has  been  combined  \nwith  MRI  to  better  define  location  of  such  area  even  in  \nsoft tissues (Table 96.2).\nUSES\n•\tPET is used to detect cancerous area and secondaries.\n•\tIt defines early, small deposits in lymph nodes.\n•\tUsed to define occult primary.\n•\tUsed postradiotherapy for recurrence, residual disease \nor metastasis.\n•\tPET has also been used in research to study physiologi-\ncally active centre when a particular area is stimulated.\nDISADVANTAGES\n•\tInflammatory  tissue  is  also  avid  for  glucose  and  may  \nbe  mistaken  for  cancer.  In  postradiation  cases,  PET  is  \npreferably done after 4 months.\n•\tGlucose  saturated  tissues  do  not  takes  up  the  traces,  \nhence it is done in fasting condition to increase avidity \nfor glucose.\nmebooksfree.com",

These high-resolution images are \nneeded  for  temporal  bones  so  that  closely  placed  struc-\ntures can also be seen (Figures 96.27–96.36).\nSometimes  a  contrast  containing  iodine  material  is  \nalso  injected  to  better  define  blood  vessels  and  tissues  \n(contrast-enhanced images).\nSince  CT  scan  uses  X-ray  beams,  they  produce  ef-\nfects  of  ionization  radiation.

        "pregnancy.\nUSES OF CT\n1.  Images  taken  in  one  plane  can  be  reconstructed  into  \nother planes. Thus CT scan taken in axial view can be \nreconstructed in coronal and sagittal plane.\n2. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions can be made. \nThey are useful, say, in facial bone fractures and head \n& neck tumours.\n3.  Slices  can  be  made  thin  with  reduction  in  interslice  \nspace called high-resolution CT (HRCT). They are use-\nful in CT of temporal bones and show finer structures \nlike ossicles, facial nerve, labyrinth and internal audi-\ntory canal. Similarly, details of other smaller tumours \ncan be seen.\n4.  Spiral  CT  helps  perform  virtual  endoscopy  of  larynx  \nand  tracheobronchoscopy  and  is  thus  a  non-invasive  \ntechnique.\n5.  By  using  contrast,  lymph  nodes  of  the  neck  in  con-\njunction with malignant tumour can be delineated.\n6. More precise aspiration cytology of deep tumours can \nbe taken under CT guidance.\nMAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)",
        "junction with malignant tumour can be delineated.\n6. More precise aspiration cytology of deep tumours can \nbe taken under CT guidance.\nMAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)\nThis modality uses magnetic field to study the tissues. In \ncontrast to CT, it does not use any ionizing radiation. Di-\nrect  images  can  be  taken  in  any  plane—the  axial,  coro-\nnal,  sagittal  or  oblique.  Machines  used  have  a  magnetic  \nstrength of 0.5, 1.5 or 3 Tesla. One Tesla is equivalent to \n10,000 Gauss (G). Magnetic field of earth has a strength of \nonly 0.5 Gauss. As the tissues are subjected to high mag-\nnetic field, their protons realign with the magnetic field, \nlose energy, and produce a signal which can be measured \nand  reconstructed  into  an  image.  Higher  the  magnetic  \nfield created by machine, better are the images.\nPULSE SEQUENCES OF MRI\nVarious pulse sequences are used in MRI and include:\n•\tT\n1\n weighted\n•\tT\n2\n weighted\n•\tSpin (proton) density\n•\tGadolinium enhanced\n•\tFat suppression",

Inversion time (TI) is used in fat suppression \nstudies to see inversion recovery time (Table 96.1).\nADVANTAGES OF MRI\n•\tNo radiation hazard.\n•\tDirect images can be produced in axial, coronal, sagittal \nor oblique planes without changing patient’s position.\n•\tSoft tissues are differentiated better than in CT images.\n•\tTumour  margins  are  defined  better.  This  is  important  \nwhen  extension  of  tumour  is  to  be  seen  in  orbital  or  \nintracranial structures.\nDISADVANTAGES OF MRI\n•\tTakes long time to take images.\n•\tProne to motion artefacts; patient has to lie still with",

This  is  important  in  \nchildren and uncooperative patients. Sometimes gen-\neral anaesthesia is required.\n•\tMore expensive than CT.\n•\tContraindicated  if  patient  is  using  cardiac  pace  mak-\ners, cochlear implants (now some implants can toler-\nate higher Tesla strength), intracranial aneurysm clips, \nmetallic foreign body in orbit (take an X-ray before do-\ning MRI) or metallic ossicular implants.\n MRI should be avoided in first trimester of pregnancy.\nPET-CT AND PET-MRI\nPositron  emission  tomography  (PET)  is  based  on  the  \nfact  that  metabolically  active  tissues  (cancer  cells)  takes  \nup glucose preferentially than the normal tissue.

It  produces  a  typical  “Thumb \nsign” on lateral X-ray film. Ampicillin was considered \nthe drug of choice but now many organisms have be-\ncome resistant to it and ceftriaxone is preferred.\n2. Acute  fulminant  fungal  sinusitis  is  an  invasive  \nsinusitis  and  is  commonly  seen  in  diabetics,  HIV  \ninfected  patients  and  transplant  patients  receiving  \nchemotherapy for immunosuppression. Therapy in \nsuch cases should be urgent, aggressive surgical de-\nbridement and amphotericin-B.\n3. Acute laryngotracheobronchitis or croup is a viral \ninfection  caused  by  parainfluenzae  type  1,  2,  and  \nsometimes  3.  Critical  area  involved  is  subglottic  \nlarynx producing oedema with stridor and respira-\ntory  distress.  X-ray  (PA  view)  larynx  shows  typical  \n“steeple  sign”  but  X-rays  are  avoided  as  any  ma-\nnipulation may precipitate acute obstruction.\n4. Adenocarcinoma  of  ethmoid  is  mostly  seen  in  \nthose exposed to wood dust.\n5. Adenoid  facies,  seen  in  adenoid  hyperplasia,  con-\nsists  of  crowded  teeth,  high-arched  palate  and  un-\nderdeveloped pinched nostrils.\n6. Ammonia  is  not  used  to  test  sense  of  smell  as  it  \nstimulates  fibres  of  trigeminal  nerve  supplying  the  \nnose and not the olfactory ones.\n7. Angio-oedema.  Deficiency  of  C\n1\n  esterase  inhibitor  \ncauses  angio-oedema.  Deficiency  of  this  inhibitor  \ncauses increased levels of C\n1\n esterase. This leads to \nanaphylatoxins which cause capillary permeability \nand  oedema.  Deficiency  of  C\n1\n  esterase  inhibitor  is  \nan inherited condition.\n8.  Area  of  adult  tympanic  membrane  is  90  mm\n2\n,  of  \nwhich  only  55  mm\n2\n  is  functional.  Area  of  stapes  \nfootplate  is  3.2  mm\n2\n. Area  ratio  (or  hydraulic  ra-\ntio) is 17:1. According to other workers, functional \narea is 45 mm\n2\n and area ratio 14:1.\n9. Arnold nerve. It is auricular branch of jugular gan-\nglion of vagus. It enters the mastoid canaliculus and \nexits  the  tympanomastoid  suture  and  supplies  skin  \nof posterior part of pinna on medial surface of con-\ncha,  and  posterior  wall  of  external  auditory  canal  \nand tympanic membrane.\n10. Arnold–Chiari  malformation.  Cerebellar  tonsils  \nproject through the foramen magnum.\n11. Axis of ossicular rotation passes between anterior \nprocess of malleus to short process of incus.\n12. Barrett’s  oesophagus.  In  the  distal  oesophagus,  \nsquamous epithelium is replaced by columnar epi-\nthelium (similar to the one that lines the stomach). \nIt  is  due  to  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease.  Carci-\nnoma can develop in 2–5% of patients with Barrett’s \noesophagus.\n13. Battle’s sign is ecchymosis over the mastoid seen in \nfractures of temporal bone.\n14. Bell’s phenomenon is seen in lower motor neuron \nparalysis  of  CN  VII.  The  eyeball  turns  up  and  out  \nwhen trying to close the eye.\n15. Bezold  abscess.  It  is  an  abscess  under  the  mastoid  \nand/or  in  the  digastric  triangle  when  empyema  of  \nthe mastoid bursts through the medial side of its tip.\n16. Bill’s  island.  It  is  a  thin  plate  of  bone  left  on  sig-\nmoid sinus when it is to be retracted during surgery. \nIt should be differentiated from Bill’s bar.\n17. Blue  drum  is  seen  in  haemotympanum  (due  to  \ntemporal bone fracture), glue ear, glomus tumour or \nhaemangioma of middle ear.\n18. Boerhaave syndrome. It is spontaneous rupture of \noesophagus due to severe vomiting.\n19. Broyles’ ligament. Small ligament which connects \nboth the vocal cords at the anterior commissure to \nthe thyroid cartilage.\n20. Bryce’s sign. Seen in laryngocele. When the swell-\ning is pressed, a gurgling sound is produced.\n21. Carcinoma of nasopharynx is caused, among other \nfactors, by Epstein–Barr virus. Most common site of or-\nigin is fossa of Rosenmüller (pharyngeal recess). Most \ncommon  histological  variety  is  squamous  cell  carci-\nnoma and radiotherapy is the treatment of choice.\n22. Carhart’s  notch  is  seen  in  otosclerosis.  Bone  con-\nduction curve shows maximum loss at 2000 Hz.\n23. Caroticotympanic  artery  is  a  branch  of  internal  \ncarotid artery. It anastomoses with branches of ex-\nternal carotid system in the middle ear.\n24. CHARGE  syndrome  consists  of  Coloboma, Heart \ndefects,  choanal  Atresia, Retarded  growth,  Genital \nhypoplasia and Ear anomalies.\n25. Choanal  atresia  is  more  often  unilateral,  more  \ncommon in females (2:1), more often on the right \nside and more often bony than membranous (9:1).\n26. Chordoma arises from the remnants of notochord. \nCharacteristic appearance on histology is physalifer-\nous cells—foamy cells with compressed nuclei.\n27. Chvostek’s  sign.

Costen  syndrome  is  abnormality  of  temporoman-\ndibular joint due to defective bite. It is characterized \nby otalgia, feeling of blocked ear, tinnitus and some-\ntimes vertigo. Pain also radiates to frontal, parietal \nand occipital region.\n31. Dalrymple’s sign. Seen in Grave disease. It is a clin-\nical sign showing retraction of upper lid with upper \nscleral show.\n32. Dandy syndrome/oscillopsia (i.e. difficulty to read \nboards  or  hoardings  while  walking).  Seen  in  bilat-\neral  loss  of  vestibular  function,  e.g.  after  systemic  \nstreptomycin therapy.\n33. Donaldson’s  line  passes  through  horizontal  canal  \nand  bisects  the  posterior  canal.  It  is  landmark  for  \nendolymphatic sac which lies anterior and inferior \nto it (Figure 79.5).\n34. Dysphagia  lusoria  is  due  to  compression  of  oe-\nsophagus by subclavian artery. It occurs when right \nsubclavian  artery  arises  from  thoracic  aorta  and  \npasses in front of or behind the oesophagus.\n35. Eagle  syndrome  (Syn.  syndrome  of  elongated  sty-\nloid process). Manifested with discomfort in throat, \npain in the ear and upper neck and dysphagia.\n36. Elastic  fibrocartilage  is  seen  in  pinna,  epiglottis,  \ncorniculate,  cuneiform  cartilages  and  apices  of  the  \narytenoid  cartilages.  It  does  not  undergo  calcifica-\ntion.  Hyaline  cartilage  is  seen  in  thyroid,  cricoid  \nand greater part of arytenoid cartilages. It undergoes \ncalcification.\n37. Endolymph is produced by cells of stria vascularis \nof the cochlea and dark cells of the vestibular laby-\nrinth. It is absorbed by endolymphatic sac.\n38. Endolymphatic sac. It is located posterior to mas-\ntoid segment of CN VII, inferior to posterior semi-\ncircular canal and superior to jugular bulb.\n39. Eustachian tube is 36 mm long, one-third is bony \nand  two-thirds  are  cartilaginous.  Normally,  it  re-\nmains closed. Opening of the tube is an active pro-\ncess due to contraction of tensor veli palatini muscle \nwhile closure is passive due to recoil of the cartilage.\n40. Exostosis of external auditory canal are multiple \nand  usually  associated  with  cold  water  swimming  \nwhile  osteoma  of  external  canal  is  usually  single  \nand occurs at suture lines, e.g. tympanomastoid.\n41. External  auditory  canal  of  an  adult  is  24  mm  in  \nlength. Outer one-third (8 mm) is cartilaginous and \ninner two-thirds (16 mm) are bony.\n42. Fluctuating hearing loss. It is seen in otitis media \nwith  effusion,  Ménière’s  disease,  perilymph  fistula,  \nautoimmune disorder of the inner ear and syphilitic \nlabyrinthitis and malingering.\n43. Frenzel manoeuvre. It is used to open the eustachi-\nan tube and ventilate the middle ear by contracting \nmuscles  of  the  floor  of  mouth  and  pharynx  while  \nnose, mouth and glottis are closed. It is a little more \ndifficult to learn than Valsalva manoeuvre.\n44. Frey’s syndrome. There is flushing and sweating of \nskin of parotid region during eating. It is seen after \nparotidectomy.   Parasympathetic   fibres   supplying   \nthe parotid gland are misdirected after parotidecto-\nmy and innervate sweat glands of the parotid area. \nTympanic neurectomy (section of tympanic branch \nof CN IX) will interrupt these fibres and give relief.\n45. Fungal sinusitis is mostly caused by Aspergillus.\n46. Galen’s anastomosis. It is anastomosis between su-\nperior and recurrent laryngeal nerves.\n47. Gelle’s  test  compares  intensity  of  bone-conducted  \ntuning  fork  sound,  without  and  with,  raising  pres-\nsure on the tympanic membrane with Siegel’s specu-\nlum. Normally, Gelle’s test is positive because inten-\nsity of hearing decreases when air pressure is raised \nin  external  auditory  canal.  In  ossicular  fixation  or  \nossicular discontinuity, increased air pressure makes \nno changes in the sound intensity (Gelle’s negative).\n48. Gradenigo  syndrome  consists  of  (i)  ear  discharge  \n(suppurative otitis media), (ii) diplopia (CN VI paral-\nysis) and (iii) retro-orbital pain (CN V) involvement. \nIt is due to petrositis—a complication of otitis media.\n49. Grisel  syndrome.  It  is  atlanto-axial  dislocation.  \nCan  follow  adenoid  surgery  or  nasopharyngeal  in-\nfections. Manifests with painful neck and torticollis.\n50. Griesinger’s sign is oedema over the mastoid and is \nseen in lateral sinus thrombosis. It is due to throm-\nbosis  of  mastoid  emissary  vein  impeding  venous  \ndrainage and thus causing oedema over the mastoid.\n51. Gutmann’s pressure test. It is done in puberphonia. \nPressing  on  the  thyroid  prominence  in  a  backward  \nand downward direction relaxes the overstretched vo-\ncal cords and thus low-pitched voice can be produced.\n52. Habenula perforata. It is the area where branches \nof cochlear nerve enter the cochlea. Openings may \nbe  wide  leading  to  a  perilymph  gusher  in  stapes  \nsurgery.  This  condition  is  associated  with  enlarged  \ninternal acoustic meatus and stapes fixation of con-\ngenital  origin.  It  is  an  X-linked  disease  and  can  be  \ndiagnosed on CT.\n53. Hennebert’s  phenomenon.  Dysequilibrium  follow-\ning nose blowing or lifting a heavy object. Seen in per-\nilymph fistula (do not confuse with Hennebert’s sign).\n54. Hennebert’s sign is a positive fistula sign in the ab-\nsence  of  fistula.  Seen  in  congenital  syphilis  due  to  \nformation of adhesions between stapes footplate and \nsaccule. Also seen in some cases of Ménière’s disease.\n55. Hidden  areas  of  the  larynx  include  infrahyoid  \nepiglottis, anterior commissure, subglottis, ventricle \nand apex of pyriform fossa.\n56. Horner  syndrome  consists  of  ptosis,  miosis  (con-\nstriction  of  pupil),  anhidrosis  and  enophthalmos  \ndue to paralysis of cervical sympathetics.\n57. Hyrtl’s fissure, also called tympanomeningeal hia-\ntus, it is an embryonic remnant that connects CSF \nspace to middle ear just anterior and inferior to the \nround  window.  It  runs  parallel  to  cochlear  aque-\nduct. It can be a source of congenital CSF otorrhoea \nor meningitis from middle ear infections. Normally \nit gets obliterated.\n58.  In  any  case  of  unilateral  otitis  media  with  effu-\nsion  in  an  adult,  rule  out  nasopharyngeal  pathol-\nogy especially the carcinoma.\n59.  In  Fitzgerald–Hallpike (bithermal caloric) test, ther-\nmal stimulation occurs in the horizontal semicircular \ncanal. Cold water (30 °C) causes nystagmus to the op-\nposite side while warm water (44 °C) to the same side. \nRemember COWS (Cold-Opposite-Warm-Same).\nmebooksfree.com",

It is characterized by \nsquamous or transitional cell epithelium with fibro-\nvascular  stroma.  Inward  growth  of  epithelium  to-\nwards stroma lends the name of inverted papilloma \nto it. It is associated with squamous cell carcinoma \nin 10–15% of patients.\n61. Jacobson’s  nerve  (Syn.  tympanic  branch  of  glos-\nsopharyngeal  nerve).  Forms  tympanic  plexus,  sup-\nplies  mucosa  of  the  middle  ear  cleft.  Its  pregangli-\nonic parasympathetic fibres leave the middle ear as \nlesser petrosal nerve and supply the parotid gland. \nSection  of  this  nerve  is  sometimes  done  to  treat  \nFrey’s syndrome.\n62. Jugular  foramen  syndrome  is  paralysis  of  CN  IX,  \nX and XI. It is seen in carcinoma nasopharynx, glo-\nmus  jugulare,  large  acoustic  neuroma  or  thrombo-\nphlebitis of jugular bulb.\n63. Kallmann  syndrome  is  anosmia  and  congenital  \nhypogonadism.\n64. Kartagener syndrome consists of recurrent sinusi-\ntis, bronchiectasis and situs inversus. Ciliary motil-\nity is disturbed. Electron microscope shows absence \nof dynein side arms in A-tubules of nasal respiratory \nmucosa.\n65. Korner’s  septum,  sometimes  seen  during  mastoid  \nsurgery, is a bony plate separating superficial squa-\nmous cells from the deeper petrosal air cells. Antrum \nlies deep to it (see p. 8, 457).\n66. Krause’s  nodes  are  lymph  nodes  situated  in  the  \njugular foramen. Enlargement of these nodes com-\npresses on CN IX, X and XI causing jugular foramen \nsyndrome.\n67.  Larynx  has  three  important  spaces:  pre-epiglottic,  \nparaglottic and Reinke’s. The first two are important \nbecause  they  are  invaded  by  carcinoma  arising  in  \nthe  laryngeal  mucosa.  Reinke’s  space  is  often  af-\nfected by oedema and causes polypoid degeneration \nof vocal cords.\n68. Lermoyez  syndrome  is  a  variant  of  Ménière’s  dis-\nease. Patient first gets hearing loss and tinnitus. An \nattack  of  vertigo  follows  and  relieves  tinnitus  and  \nimproves hearing.\n69. Lever ratio between the handle of malleus and the \nlong process of incus is 1.3:1.\n70. Lhermitte’s sign. A rare sign seen after radiation of \ncervical spine. Electrical current-like sensation is felt \nin both arms, dorsal spine and both legs on flexing \nthe neck.\n71. Lyre’s sign. It is splaying apart of internal and exter-\nnal carotid arteries on angiogram in cases of carotid \nbody tumour of the neck.\n72. Malleus and incus are derived from the first arch. \nStapes  develops  from  second  arch  except  its  foot-\nplate and annular ligament which are derived from \nthe otic capsule.\n73. Marcus Gunn pupil. This is due to interruption of \nafferent  papillary  pathway  due  to  retrobulbar  neu-\nritis  or  any  other  optic  nerve  disease.  When  light  \nis put on the diseased side, the pupils of both sides \nremain  dilated  but  when  the  light  is  put  on  the  \nhealthy side it constricts both the pupils. In the lat-\nter case pupil on diseased side constricts due to con-\nsensual light reflex because the efferent pathway on \nthe diseased side is normal. It is an important sign \nduring  endoscopic  sinus  surgery  for  any  injury  to  \nthe optic nerve.\n74. Marcus Gunn syndrome. Opening of mouth causes \nopening of eyes and closing of mouth causes ptosis. \nThis is due to associated movements following facial \nparalysis and faulty regeneration of facial nerve fibres.\n75. Mastoid antrum lies 12–15 mm deep from the surface \nof  suprameatal  triangle  in  an  adult.  The  thickness  of  \nthe bone overlying the antrum is only 2 mm at birth \nand then increases at the rate of 1 mm every year.\n76. Mastoid  tip  does  not  develop  till  2  years;  hence  \npostaural  incision  to  open  the  mastoid  before  this  \nage needs to be modified to avoid injury to the fa-\ncial nerve.\n77. Michel aplasia. There is total lack of development \nof inner ear. It can be confused radiologically with \nlabyrinthine  ossification  and  can  be  distinguished  \nby MRI which may show membranous labyrinth in \nthe latter.\n78. Modiolus  is  the  central  bony  axis  of  cochlea  and  \nmeasures 5 mm in length.\n79.  Most common organism responsible for acute bac-\nterial  sinusitis  is  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  followed  \nby Haemophilus influenzae. Anaerobic and mixed in-\nfections are seen in sinusitis of dental origin.\n80. Most common organisms in acute otitis media are \nS. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis \nin decreasing order.\n81. Most  common  site  for  epistaxis  (90%)  is  Little’s  \narea situated on anteroinferior part of nasal septum.\n82. Most  common  site  of  involvement  in  stapedial  \notosclerosis  is  located  at  the  anterior  edge  of  oval  \nwindow in the area of fissula ante fenestram.\n83. Mouse-nibbled   appearance   of   vocal   cords   is   \ncaused by tuberculosis.\n84. Mucormycosis  is  acute  invasive  fungal  infection  \ninvolving nose and paranasal sinuses, where fungal \nhyphae invade blood vessels causing ischaemic ne-\ncrosis.  Commonly  involves  lateral  nasal  walls  and  \nturbinates and quickly spreads to orbit, palate, face \nand  cranium.  Treatment  is  surgical  debridement  \nand amphotericin-B.\n85. Müller’s manoeuvre. Used to find the level and de-\ngree  of  obstruction  in  sleep-disordered  breathing.  \nIt is performed while using flexible nasopharyngo-\nscope. First the examiner sees the upper airways at \nrest and then during the time when patient makes \nmaximal  inspiratory  effort  with  nose  and  mouth  \nclosed. Base of tongue, lateral pharyngeal wall and \npalate are examined for collapsibility and then rated \nfrom 0 (minimal collapse) to 4+ (complete collapse).\n86. Multiple  juvenile  laryngeal  papillomatosis  is  a  \nbenign condition caused by human papilloma virus \nsubtype  6  and  11.  Treatment  of  choice  is  repeated  \nexcision  with  CO\n2\n  laser.  Malignant  change  is  un-\ncommon unless radiation has been used as a mode \nof treatment.\n87. Muscles of the palate. All muscles of the palate are \nsupplied  by  the  pharyngeal  plexus  except  tensor  \nveli palatini which is supplied by N to medial ptery-\ngoid (CN V).\nmebooksfree.com",

Marcus Gunn pupil. This is due to interruption of \nafferent  papillary  pathway  due  to  retrobulbar  neu-\nritis  or  any  other  optic  nerve  disease.  When  light  \nis put on the diseased side, the pupils of both sides \nremain  dilated  but  when  the  light  is  put  on  the  \nhealthy side it constricts both the pupils. In the lat-\nter case pupil on diseased side constricts due to con-\nsensual light reflex because the efferent pathway on \nthe diseased side is normal.

Tolosa–Hunt  syndrome  causes  unilateral  orbital  \npain with one or more of CN III, IV and VI palsies \nwhich  are  episodic.  There  is  granulation  tissue  in  \ncavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure or orbit. It \nis treated by steroids.\n127. Tone decay, also called auditory fatigue, is change \nin  auditory  threshold  when  a  continuous  tone  is  \npresented to the ear. It is seen in acoustic neuroma \nand other retrocochlear lesions.\n128. Trautmann’s  triangle  is  bounded  by  the  bony  \nlabyrinth  anteriorly,  sigmoid  sinus  posteriorly  and  \nthe  dura  or  superior  petrosal  sinus  superiorly  (Fig-\nure 80.2).\n129. Treatment of choice for antrochoanal polyp in a \nchild  is  functional  endoscopic  sinus  surgery  (FESS)  \nor intranasal polypectomy. Caldwell–Luc operation \nis avoided.\n130. Trotter (or Sinus of Morgagni) syndrome or triad \nis seen in nasopharyngeal carcinoma which spreads \nlaterally to involve the sinus of Morgagni involving \nmandibular nerve. It is characterized by:\n(a) Conductive hearing loss (due to eustachian tube \nobstruction).\n(b) Ipsilateral immobility of soft palate.\n(c) Neuralgic pain in the distribution of V3.\n1.  Trismus  and  preauricular  fullness  may  be  \nassociated with the above.\n131. Tullio phenomenon. Loud sound produces vertigo. \nIt is seen in congenital syphilis or when three func-\ntioning  windows  are  present  in  the  ear—oval  win-\ndow,  round  window  and  an  extra  window—fistula  \nof  the  semicircular  canal  or  fenestration  operation  \nin the presence of mobile footplate of stapes.\n132. Turban epiglottis is due to oedema and infiltration \nof the epiglottis and is caused by laryngeal tubercu-\nlosis. Lupus—a  form  of  tuberculosis,  on  the  other  \nhand, eats away and destroys the epiglottis.\n133. Tympanic  membrane  develops  from  all  the  three  \ngerminal  layers:  ectoderm  (outer  epithelial  layer)  \nmesoderm (middle fibrous layer) and endoderm (in-\nner mucosal layer).\n134. Ventricle of Morgagni (Syn. laryngeal ventricle be-\ntween true and false cords). Differentiate it from the \nsinus of Morgagni.\n135. Vertical and anteroposterior dimensions of mid-\ndle ear are 15 mm each while transverse dimension \nis  2  mm  at  mesotympanum,  6  mm  above  at  the  \nepitympanum and 4 mm below in the hypotympa-\nnum.  Thus,  the  middle  ear  is  the  narrowest  space  \nbetween the umbo and promontory.\n136. Vocal  nodules  occur  at  the  junction  of  anterior  \nwith  middle  third  of  vocal  cords  as  this  is  the  site  \nwith the maximum vibratory area during speech.\n137.
