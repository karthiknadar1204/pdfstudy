Designed as a highly agentic\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, PlumAi combines the Tavily LLM Search API and OpenAI API to\ndeliver precise, context-aware search results tailored to your needs.  Built with NextJS, this tool seamlessly blends\nintelligent retrieval with powerful generative capabilities,  making it perfect for digging deep into topics or quickly\nfinding answers.  Whether you’re researching or troubleshooting.  (Try it here)\nFormify, an innovative AI-powered form builder that simplifies data collection and analysis.  Built using NextJS, it\nharnesses the Gemini API to generate dynamic forms from text and the OpenAI API to enable chatting with responses\nfor deeper insights.  It also leverages OpenAI’s tool invocation for graphical visualization through interactive charts.\nWith features like exporting responses to Excel and AI-driven insights, Formify lets you export the responses to Excel\neffortlessly, making response analysis and decision-making a breeze.  (Try it here)\nDataSensei, a groundbreaking AI-powered platform that lets users chat with their entire database using everyday\nlanguage.  Built using NextJS, this agentic tool is designed for seamless end-to-end data querying, insights generation,\nand dynamic visualization.  Powered by the OpenAI API, it leverages large language models (LLMs) and AI-driven\nretrieval to deliver instant answers, spot trends, and create stunning graphical insights with Recharts for visualizations.\nPlus, with Instructor JS reducing hallucinations, you can trust the results to be sharp and reliable.  (Try it here)\nAvocadoAi,  a cutting-edge AI-powered video generator that transforms text into engaging videos.  It seamlessly\nintegrates Grok for script creation, AssemblyAI for high-quality text-to-speech, and OpenAI for accurate captioning.\nThe project also combines stunning AI-generated images—crafted using the Flux model—with premium Getty images\nsourced via the Pexels API. (Try it here)\nStickyNote AI, an innovative AI-powered note-taking app that lets you create small sticky notes and even chat\nwith them!  Built using NextJS and the OpenAI API, this project brings a fun and interactive twist to organizing\nyour thoughts.

Built using NextJS, this\nplatform empowers students to effortlessly filter events based on their preferences, making event discovery faster and\nmore enjoyable.  We scraped the entire college website to gather comprehensive event details, creating a one-stop hub\nfor campus happenings.  The site gained over 700 users in just two days and earned a spot alongside the official site\nas a go-to resource.  (Try it here)\nDBChat,  a  powerful  AI-driven  tool  designed  to  simplify  database  management  by  generating  SQL  queries  for\nPostgreSQL. Built using NextJS, this app harnesses the OpenAI API to create accurate and efficient SQL queries\nfrom natural language input, making it easier for users to interact with their databases without deep SQL expertise.\nWhether you’re querying data, exploring trends, or managing records, DBChat streamlines the process with a sleek,\nmodern interface.
